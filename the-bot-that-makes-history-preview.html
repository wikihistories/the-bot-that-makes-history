<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Digging Wikipedia: The Online Encyclopedia as a Digital Cultural Heritage Gateway and Site;,citation_abstract=The online encyclopedia Wikipedia is both a cultural reference to store, refer to, and organize digitized and digital information, as well as a key contemporary digital heritage endeavor in itself. Capitalizing on this dual nature of the project, this article introduces Wikipedia as a digital gateway to and site of an active engagement with cultural heritage. We have developed the open source and freely available analysis architecture Contropedia to examine already existing volunteer user-generated participation around cultural heritage and to promote further engagement with it. Conceptually, we employ the notion of memory work, as it helps to treat Wikipedia’s articles, edit histories, and discussion pages as a rich resource to study how cultural heritage is received and (re)worked in and across languages and cultures. Contropedia’s architecture allows for the study of the negotiations around and appreciation of cultural heritage without assuming an unchallenged and universal understanding of cultural heritage. The analysis facilitated by Contropedia thus sheds light on the contentious articulation of perspectives on tangible and intangible heritage grounded by conflicting conceptions of events, ideas, places, or persons. Technologically, Contropedia combines techniques based on mining article edit histories and analyzing discussion patterns in talk pages to identify and visualize heritage-related disputes within an article, and to compare these across language versions. In terms of digital heritage, Contropedia presents a powerful tool that opens up a core resource to cultural heritage studies. Moreover, it can form part of a conceptually grounded, technically advanced, and practically enrolled infrastructure for public education that opens up the dynamic formation of both knowledge about cultural heritage and new forms of digital cultural heritage that show a considerable amount of friction.;,citation_author=Christian Pentzold;,citation_author=Esther Weltevrede;,citation_author=Michele Mauri;,citation_author=David Laniado;,citation_author=Andreas Kaltenbrunner;,citation_author=Erik Borra;,citation_publication_date=2017-04;,citation_cover_date=2017-04;,citation_year=2017;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3012285;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1145/3012285;,citation_issn=1556-4673, 1556-4711;,citation_volume=10;,citation_journal_title=Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Event Detection in Wikipedia Edit History Improved by Documents Web Based Automatic Assessment;,citation_abstract=A majority of current work in events extraction assumes the static nature of relationships in constant expertise knowledge bases. However, in collaborative environments, such as Wikipedia, information and systems are extraordinarily dynamic over time. In this work, we introduce a new approach for extracting complex structures of events from Wikipedia. We advocate a new model to represent events by engaging more than one entities that are generalizable to an arbitrary language. The evolution of an event is captured successfully primarily based on analyzing the user edits records in Wikipedia. Our work presents a basis for a singular class of evolution-aware entity-primarily based enrichment algorithms and will extensively increase the quality of entity accessibility and temporal retrieval for Wikipedia. We formalize this problem case and conduct comprehensive experiments on a real dataset of 1.8 million Wikipedia articles in order to show the effectiveness of our proposed answer. Furthermore, we suggest a new event validation automatic method relying on a supervised model to predict the presence of events in a non-annotated corpus. As the extra document source for event validation, we chose the Web due to its ease of accessibility and wide event coverage. Our outcomes display that we are capable of acquiring 70% precision evaluated on a manually annotated corpus. Ultimately, we conduct a comparison of our strategy versus the Current Event Portal of Wikipedia and discover that our proposed WikipEvent along with the usage of Co-References technique may be utilized to provide new and more data on events.;,citation_author=Marco Fisichella;,citation_author=Andrea Ceroni;,citation_publication_date=2021-09;,citation_cover_date=2021-09;,citation_year=2021;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/5/3/34;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.3390/bdcc5030034;,citation_issn=2504-2289;,citation_volume=5;,citation_journal_title=Big Data and Cognitive Computing;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Good Faith Collaboration : The Culture of Wikipedia;,citation_abstract=How Wikipedia collaboration addresses the challenges of openness, consensus, and leadership in a historical pursuit for a universal encyclopedia. Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, is built by a community—a community of Wikipedians who are expected to “assume good faith” when interacting with one another. In Good Faith Collaboration, Joseph Reagle examines this unique collaborative culture. Wikipedia, says Reagle, is not the first effort to create a freely shared, universal encyclopedia; its early twentieth-century ancestors include Paul Otlet’s Universal Repository and H. G. Wells’s proposal for a World Brain. Both these projects, like Wikipedia, were fuelled by new technology—which at the time included index cards and microfilm. What distinguishes Wikipedia from these and other more recent ventures is Wikipedia’s good-faith collaborative culture, as seen not only in the writing and editing of articles but also in their discussion pages and edit histories. Keeping an open perspective on both knowledge claims and other contributors, Reagle argues, creates an extraordinary collaborative potential. Wikipedia’s style of collaborative production has been imitated, analyzed, and satirized. Despite the social unease over its implications for individual autonomy, institutional authority, and the character (and quality) of cultural products, Wikipedia’s good-faith collaborative culture has brought us closer than ever to a realization of the century-old pursuit of a universal encyclopedia.;,citation_author=Joseph Reagle;,citation_publication_date=2010;,citation_cover_date=2010;,citation_year=2010;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://directory.doabooks.org/handle/20.500.12854/77881;,citation_isbn=978-0-262-28971-9 978-0-262-01447-2;">

It first gives an overview of the recent handbooks and anthologies of memory studies, which testify to the institutionalisation of the young discipline. Then, it discusses the emergence of cultural memory studies, one of the most fruitful and promising trends in the memory studies of the last decade. And finally, it addresses the old debate over the relationship of history and memory, in order to propose an alternative conceptual framework for it and demonstrate the perspectives opened by a new avenue of research, mnemohistory. To conclude with, it argues that the rise of memory studies can be regarded as part of a broader change in how we nowadays see time and the interrelations of the past, the present and the future.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Wikipedia @ 20: Stories of an Incomplete Revolution;,citation_abstract=Wikipedia’s first twenty years: how what began as an experiment in collaboration became the world’s most popular reference work. We have been looking things up in Wikipedia for twenty years. What began almost by accident—a wiki attached to a nascent online encyclopedia—has become the world’s most popular reference work. Regarded at first as the scholarly equivalent of a Big Mac, Wikipedia is now known for its reliable sourcing and as a bastion of (mostly) reasoned interaction. How has Wikipedia, built on a model of radical collaboration, remained true to its original mission of “free access to the sum of all human knowledge” when other tech phenomena have devolved into advertising platforms? In this book, scholars, activists, and volunteers reflect on Wikipedia’s first twenty years, revealing connections across disciplines and borders, languages and data, the professional and personal. The contributors consider Wikipedia’s history, the richness of the connections that underpin it, and its founding vision. Their essays look at, among other things, the shift from bewilderment to respect in press coverage of Wikipedia; Wikipedia as “the most important laboratory for social scientific and computing research in history”; and the acknowledgment that “free access” includes not just access to the material but freedom to contribute—that the summation of all human knowledge is biased by who documents it.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The DBpedia Events Dataset;,citation_abstract=Wikipedia is the largest encyclopedia worldwide and is frequently updated by thousands of collaborators. A large part of the knowledge in Wikipedia is not static, but frequently updated, e. g., political events or new movies. This makes Wikipedia an extremely rich, crowdsourced information hub for events. However, currently there is no structured and standardised way to access information on those events and it is cumbersome to filter and enrich them manually. We have created a dataset based on a live extraction of Wikipedia, which performs this task via rules for filtering and ranking updates in DBpedia Live.;,citation_author=Magnus Knuth;,citation_author=Jens Lehmann;,citation_author=D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Visual Narratives and Collective Memory across Peer-Produced Accounts of Contested Sociopolitical Events;,citation_abstract=Studying cultural variation in recollections of sociopolitical events is crucial for achieving diverse understandings of such events. To date, most studies in this area have focused on analyzing variation in texts describing events. Here, we analyze variation in image usage across Wikipedia language editions to understand if, like text, visual narratives reflect distinct perspectives in articles about culturally-tethered events. We focus on articles about coup d’états as an example of highly contextual sociopolitical events likely to display such variation. The key challenge to examining variation in images is that there is no existing framework to use as a basis for comparison. To address this challenge, we use an iterative inductive coding process to arrive at a 46-item typology for categorizing the content of images relating to contested sociopolitical events, and a typology of network motifs that characterizes structural patterns of image use. We apply these typologies in a large-scale quantitative analysis that establishes clusters of image themes, two detailed qualitative case studies comparing Wikipedia articles on coup d’états in Soviet Russia and Egypt, and four quantitative analyses clustering image themes by language usage at the article level. These analyses document variation in imagery around particular events and variation in tendencies across cultures. We find substantial cultural variation in both content and network structure. This study presents a novel methodological framework for uncovering culturally divergent perspective of political crises through imagery on Wikipedia.;,citation_author=Emily Porter;,citation_author=P.

After its first release in July 2020, the Research team has developed the second complete draft of a taxonomy of knowledge gaps for the Wikimedia projects, as the first step towards building the knowledge gap index. We studied more than 250 references by scholars, researchers, practitioners, community members and affiliates – exposing evidence of knowledge gaps in readership, contributorship, and content of Wikimedia projects. We elaborated the findings and compiled the taxonomy of knowledge gaps in this paper, where we describe, group and classify knowledge gaps into a structured framework. The taxonomy that you will learn more about in the rest of this work will serve as a basis to operationalize and quantify knowledge equity, one of the two 2030 strategic directions, through the knowledge gaps index.;,citation_author=Miriam Redi;,citation_author=Martin Gerlach;,citation_author=Isaac Johnson;,citation_author=Jonathan Morgan;,citation_author=Leila Zia;,citation_publication_date=2021-01;,citation_cover_date=2021-01;,citation_year=2021;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12314;,citation_doi=10.48550/arXiv.2008.12314;,citation_publisher=arXiv;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Black Lives Matter in Wikipedia: Collaboration and Collective Memory around Online Social Movements;,citation_abstract=Social movements use social computing systems to complement offline mobilizations, but prior literature has focused almost exclusively on movement actors’ use of social media. In this paper, we analyze participation and attention to topics connected with the Black Lives Matter movement in the English language version of Wikipedia between 2014 and 2016. Our results point to the use of Wikipedia to (1) intensively document and connect historical and contemporary events, (2) collaboratively migrate activity to support coverage of new events, and (3) dynamically re-appraise pre-existing knowledge in the aftermath of new events. These findings reveal patterns of behavior that complement theories of collective memory and collective action and help explain how social computing systems can encode and retrieve knowledge about social movements as they unfold.;,citation_author=Marlon Twyman;,citation_author=Brian C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Toward an epistemology of Wikipedia;,citation_abstract=Wikipedia (the “free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit”) is having a huge impact on how a great many people gather information about the world. So, it is important for epistemologists and information scientists to ask whether people are likely to acquire knowledge as a result of having access to this information source. In other words, is Wikipedia having good epistemic consequences? After surveying the various concerns that have been raised about the reliability of Wikipedia, this article argues that the epistemic consequences of people using Wikipedia as a source of information are likely to be quite good. According to several empirical studies, the reliability of Wikipedia compares favorably to the reliability of traditional encyclopedias. Furthermore, the reliability of Wikipedia compares even more favorably to the reliability of those information sources that people would be likely to use if Wikipedia did not exist (viz., Web sites that are as freely and easily accessible as Wikipedia). In addition, Wikipedia has a number of other epistemic virtues (e.g., power, speed, and fecundity) that arguably outweigh any deficiency in terms of reliability. Even so, epistemologists and information scientists should certainly be trying to identify changes (or alternatives) to Wikipedia that will bring about even better epistemic consequences. This article suggests that to improve Wikipedia, we need to clarify what our epistemic values are and to better understand why Wikipedia works as well as it does. Somebody who reads Wikipedia is “rather in the position of a visitor to a public restroom,” says Mr. McHenry, Britannica’s former editor. “It may be obviously dirty, so that he knows to exercise great care, or it may seem fairly clean, so that he may be lulled into a false sense of security. What he certainly does not know is who has used the facilities before him.” One wonders whether people like Mr. McHenry would prefer there to be no public lavatories at all.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Fixing the floating gap: The online encyclopaedia Wikipedia as a global memory place;,citation_abstract=The article proposes to interpret the web-based encyclopaedia Wikipedia as a global memory place. After presenting the core elements and basic characteristics of wikis and Wikipedia respectively, the article discusses four related issues of social memory studies: collective memory, communicative and cultural memory, “memory places” and the “floating gap”. In a third step, these theoretical premises are connected to the understanding of discourse as social cognition. Fourth, comparison is made between the potential of the World Wide Web as cyberspace for collective remembrance and the obstacles that stand in its way. On this basis, the article argues that Wikipedia presents a global memory place where memorable elements are negotiated. Its complex processes of discussion and article creation are a model of the discursive fabrication of memory. Thus, they can be viewed and analysed as the transition, the “floating gap” between communicative and collective frames of memory.;,citation_author=Christian Pentzold;,citation_publication_date=2009-05;,citation_cover_date=2009-05;,citation_year=2009;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1750698008102055;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1177/1750698008102055;,citation_issn=1750-6980, 1750-6999;,citation_volume=2;,citation_journal_title=Memory Studies;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Wikipedia: A self-organizing bureaucracy;,citation_abstract=Many authors have argued that digital technologies enable collaboration without central oversight or authority, obviating the need for the hierarchical bureaucracies that characterize industrial capitalism. In this context, Wikipedia is often mentioned as a paradigmatic example. We draw on the classical accounts of Robert Michels and Max Weber to study mechanisms pushing towards or away from power concentration and bureaucratization. Our historical analysis of bureaucratization and power concentration in Wikipedia is based on 118 conversations and interviews as well as extensive archival research. While most studies on Wikipedia only consider the online encyclopedia itself, we also scrutinize the Wikimedia Foundation. Our analysis uncovers alternating processes of power concentration and power diffusion. While we observe power concentration for reasons anticipated by Michels, we also find strong counter-tendencies. Consequently, power concentration does not follow an “iron law” but is the contingent outcome of struggles among stakeholders. In line with Weber, we identify a process of progressive bureaucratization. This does not only result from the pursuit of organizational manageability, but from a quest for democratic equality and minimization of domination as well. We introduce the concept of self-organizing bureaucratization to highlight how bureaucratization is the unintended and emergent outcome of efforts to increase democratic accountability.;,citation_author=Emiel Rijshouwer;,citation_author=Justus Uitermark;,citation_author=Willem Koster;,citation_publication_date=2021-10;,citation_cover_date=2021-10;,citation_year=2021;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2021.1994633;,citation_issue=0;,citation_doi=10.1080/1369118X.2021.1994633;,citation_issn=1369-118X;,citation_volume=0;,citation_journal_title=Information, Communication &amp;amp;amp; Society;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Beyond the Grey Zone: Organization Research Publishing and Bibliodiversity in the Research Communication System;,citation_abstract=Research publishing involves the production, use and management of research in a variety of genres and formats by commercial and non-profit academic publishers, and by organizations in government, civil society, university and industry sectors. However discussion of research publishing mainly tends to focus on the production and circulation of peer-reviewed academic journals and to a lesser extent books produced by commercial academic publishers. Research reports and papers produced by organizations outside the formal publishing system play a critical role in the research and development (R&amp;amp;amp;D) system, yet they are often overlooked in studies on open scholarship and research communication. This is partly due to a lack of terminology to adequately describe the diverse publishing practices of organizations which operate across a spectrum from formal to informal economic activity. In this article I define and contextualise research publishing by organizations in relation to other forms of academic publishing and recent calls for greater bibliodiversity in scholarly communication. Commonly used terms such as “grey literature” or “unpublished literature” are inadequate to describe and account for the proliferation and importance of diverse research genres and formats able to be produced, published and disseminated in print and online by think tanks, government agencies, industry bodies and research centres. By taking a more holistic, systems-oriented approach to research publishing we can begin to understand the diverse actors, institutions and practices involved in knowledge production and develop appropriate policies, infrastructure and management practices to support an effective, efficient, equitable, credible and sustainable research knowledge commons in the public interest.;,citation_author=Amanda Lawrence;,citation_publication_date=2021-11;,citation_cover_date=2021-11;,citation_year=2021;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://popjournal.ca/issue03/lawrence;,citation_issue=3;,citation_journal_title=Pop!

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Wikipedia and history: A worthwhile partnership in the digital era?;,citation_abstract=It is hard to ignore the changes that have occurred to history-making in the digital age. Historians in the academy have observed, critiqued and, in some instances, engaged in the different forms of contemporary history that are related to the integration of the internet and related technologies into everyday lives. While digital history takes many forms, this paper examines Wikipedia as a mode of historical expression in the context of a project on the history of the Australian Paralympic Movement. Wikipedia’s key core content policies of verification, no original research, and neutral point of view (NPOV) as well as the collaborative premise that underpins the online encyclopaedia are the focal points of analysis. This analysis demonstrates that Wikipedia challenges historians who have traditionally produced the professionally approved artefacts of monographs and journal articles. In essence, Wikipedia requires historians to produce knowledge as part of a collaborative community of practice and, in the process, abandon popular theories of truth that underpin empirical-analytical history. Even given these challenges, the history of the Australian Paralympic Movement shows that Wikipedia can be important to history-making in the digital age in at least two ways. Wikipedia provides a mode of historical expression that is complementary to the narratives of traditional books, and the online encyclopaedia generates a community which has produced articles that have enhanced knowledge about the history of disability sport.;,citation_author=Murray G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Witnessing Australian Stories: History, Testimony, and Memory in Contemporary Culture;,citation_abstract=This book is about how Australians have responded to stories about suffering and injustice in Australia, presented in a range of public media, including literature, history, films, and television. Those who have responded are both ordinary and prominent Australians—politicians, writers, and scholars. All have sought to come to terms with Australia’s history by responding empathetically to stories of its marginalized citizens.Drawing upon international scholarship on collective memory, public history, testimony, and witnessing, this book represents a cultural history of contemporary Australia. It examines the forms of witnessing that dominated Australian public culture at the turn of the millennium. Since the late 1980s, witnessing has developed in Australia in response to the increasingly audible voices of indigenous peoples, migrants, and more recently, asylum seekers. As these voices became public, they posed a challenge not only to scholars and politicians, but also, most importantly, to ordinary citizens.When former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd delivered his historic apology to Australia’s indigenous peoples in February 2008, he performed an act of collective witnessing that affirmed the testimony and experiences of Aboriginal Australians. The phenomenon of witnessing became crucial, not only to the recognition and reparation of past injustices, but to efforts to create a more cosmopolitan Australia in the present. This is a vital addition to Transaction’s critically acclaimed Memory and Narrative series.;,citation_author=Kelly Jean Butler;,citation_publication_date=2017-10;,citation_cover_date=2017-10;,citation_year=2017;,citation_doi=10.4324/9781315135809;,citation_isbn=978-1-315-13580-9;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Being Australian: Narratives of national identity;,citation_abstract=After a century of speculation by writers, filmmakers, travelers and scholars, being Australian’ has become a recognisable shorthand for a group of national characteristics. Now, in an era of international terrorism, being seen as un-Australian’ has become a potent rhetorical weapon for some, and a badge of honour for others.Catriona Elder explores the origins, meaning and effects of the many stories we tell about ourselves, and how they have changed over time. She outlines some of the traditional stories and their role in Australian nationalism, and she shows how concepts of egalitarianism, peaceful settlement and sporting prowess have been used to create a national identity. Elder also investigates the cultural and social perspectives that have been used to critique dominant accounts of Australian identity, including ideas of class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity and race. She shows how these critiques have been, in turn, queried in recent years. Being Australian is an ideal introduction to studying Australia for anyone interested in understanding Australian society, culture and history. A clever work: incisive and original.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Making Australian history;,citation_abstract=Australian history has been revised and reinterpreted by successive generations of historians, writers, governments and public commentators, yet there has been no account of the ways it has changed, who makes history, and how. Making Australian History responds to this critical gap in Australian historical research.A few years ago Anna Clark saw a series of paintings on a sandstone cliff face in the Northern Territory. There were characteristic crosshatched images of fat barramundi and turtles, as well as sprayed handprints and several human figures with spears. Next to them was a long gun, painted with white ochre, an unmistakable image of the colonisers. Was this an Indigenous rendering of contact? A work of history?Each piece of history has a message and context that depends on who wrote it and when. Australian history has swirled and contorted over the years: the history wars have embroiled historians, politicians and public commentators alike, while debates over historical fiction have been as divisive. History isn’t just about understanding what happened and why. It also reflects the persuasions, politics and prejudices of its authors. Each iteration of Australia’s national story reveals not only the past in question, but also the guiding concerns and perceptions of each generation of history makers.Making Australian History is bold and inclusive: it catalogues and contextualises changing readings of the past, it examines the increasingly problematic role of historians as national storytellers, and it incorporates the stories of people;,citation_author=Anna Clark;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_isbn=978-1-76089-851-9;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Not notable enough: Feminism and expertise in Wikipedia;,citation_abstract=Wikipedia promotes itself as a community that anyone can join as long as they know the rules. In this paper, we reflect on our attempt to join this community and to edit Wikientries on ageing so that they include an intersectional perspective, especially with regard to gender. Our excursion into Wikipedia reveals how certain entries act as sites of contestation between different communities of practice, such as feminist scholars and Wikipedia experts. We document and discuss three interconnected discursive guidelines over which contestation takes place: notability, verifiability, and tone. These guidelines govern the way that Wikipedia operates in relationship to dominant discourses on age and gender.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Is Wikipedia growing a longer tail?;,citation_abstract=Wikipedia has millions of articles, many of which receive little attention. One group of Wikipedians believes these obscure entries should be removed because they are uninteresting and neglected; these are the deletionists. Other Wikipedians disagree, arguing that this long tail of articles is precisely Wikipedia’s advantage over other encyclopedias; these are the inclusionists. This paper looks at two overarching questions on the debate between deletionists and inclusionists: (1) What are the implications to the long tail of the evolving standards for article birth and death? (2) How is viewership affected by the decreasing notability of articles in the long tail? The answers to five detailed research questions that are inspired by these overarching questions should help better frame this debate and provide insight into how Wikipedia is evolving.;,citation_author=Shyong (Tony) K.

As the most influential crowd-sourced encyclopedia, Wikipedia promises – but does not necessarily deliver – a democratic corrective to the generation of knowledge, including academic knowledge. This article explores multiple mechanisms by which women either enter or disappear from the disciplinary record by analyzing the unfolding interaction between the canonical disciplinary history of sociology and Wikipedia.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Ms. Categorized: Gender, notability, and inequality on Wikipedia;,citation_abstract=Gender is one of the most pervasive and insidious forms of inequality. For example, English-language Wikipedia contains more than 1.5 million biographies about notable writers, inventors, and academics, but less than 19% of these biographies are about women. To try and improve these statistics, activists host ?edit-a-thons? to increase the visibility of notable women. While this strategy helps create several biographies previously inexistent, it fails to address a more inconspicuous form of gender exclusion. Drawing on ethnographic observations, interviews, and quantitative analysis of web-scraped metadata, this article demonstrates that biographies about women who meet Wikipedia?s criteria for inclusion are more frequently considered non-notable and nominated for deletion compared to men?s biographies. This disproportionate rate is another dimension of gender inequality previously unexplored by social scientists and provides broader insights into how women?s achievements are (under)valued.;,citation_author=Francesca Tripodi;,citation_publication_date=2021-06;,citation_cover_date=2021-06;,citation_year=2021;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1177/14614448211023772;,citation_doi=10.1177/14614448211023772;,citation_issn=1461-4448;,citation_journal_title=New Media &amp;amp;amp; Society;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cultural Memory and Early Civilization: Writing, Remembrance, and Political Imagination;,citation_abstract=Now available to an English-speaking audience, this book presents a groundbreaking theoretical analysis of memory, identity and culture. It investigates how cultures remember, arguing that human memory exists and is communicated in two ways, namely inter-human interaction and in external systems of notation, such as writing, which can span generations. Dr Assmann defines two theoretical concepts of cultural memory, differentiating between the long-term memory of societies, which can span up to 3,000 years, and communicative memory, which is typically restricted to 80 to 100 years. He applies this theoretical framework to case studies of four specific cultures, illustrating the function contexts and specific achievements, including the state, international law, religion and science. Ultimately, his research demonstrates that memory is not simply a means of retaining information, but rather a force that can shape cultural identity and allow cultures to respond creatively to both daily challenges and catastrophic changes.;,citation_author=Jan Assmann;,citation_publication_date=2011;,citation_cover_date=2011;,citation_year=2011;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cultural-memory-and-early-civilization/BCCB31EDCBF10BAF4F9B084B4BC6E5A7;,citation_doi=10.1017/CBO9780511996306;,citation_isbn=978-0-521-76381-3;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=WP:NOT, WP:NPOV, and Other Stories Wikipedia Tells Us: A Feminist Critique of Wikipedia’s Epistemology;,citation_abstract=Wikipedia has become increasingly prominent in online search results, serving as an initial path for the public to access ?facts,? and lending plausibility to its autobiographical claim to be ?the sum of all human knowledge.? However, this self-conception elides Wikipedia?s role as the world?s largest online site of encyclopedic knowledge production. A repository for established facts, Wikipedia is also a social space in which the facts themselves are decided. As a community, Wikipedia is guided by the five pillars?principles that inform and undergird the prevailing epistemic and social norms and practices for Wikipedia participation and contributions. We contend these pillars lend structural support to and help entrench Wikipedia?s gender gap as well as its lack of diversity in both participation and content. In upholding these pillars, Wikipedians may unknowingly undermine otherwise reasonable calls for inclusivity, subsequently reproducing systemic biases. We propose an alternative set of pillars developed through the lens of feminist epistemology, drawing on Lorraine Code?s notion of epistemic responsibility and Helen Longino?s notion of procedural objectivity.

Most of us complain that there aren’t enough hours in the day and too many e-mails in our thumb-accessible inboxes. This widespread perception that life is faster than it used to be is now ingrained in our culture, and smartphones and the Internet are continually being blamed. But isn’t the sole purpose of the smartphone to give us such quick access to people and information that we’ll be free to do other things? Isn’t technology supposed to make our lives easier? In Pressed for Time, Judy Wajcman explains why we immediately interpret our experiences with digital technology as inexorably accelerating everyday life. She argues that we are not mere hostages to communication devices, and the sense of always being rushed is the result of the priorities and parameters we ourselves set rather than the machines that help us set them. Indeed, being busy and having action-packed lives has become valorized by our productivity driven culture. Wajcman offers a bracing historical perspective, exploring the commodification of clock time, and how the speed of the industrial age became identified with progress. She also delves into the ways time-use differs for diverse groups in modern societies, showing how changes in work patterns, family arrangements, and parenting all affect time stress.

However, this article suggests that the achievement of this promise is fraught with difficulty and that a more likely outcome is a mapping of the status quo in historical representation onto the new media. To illustrate this, I present an analysis of the Wikipedia accounts of Singaporean and Philippine history. For Singapore, alternative historical visions are not as developed as those for the Philippines, and this is reflected in the nature of the respective Wikipedia accounts. I suggest that a possible means to achieve something more of the promise of digital media for history is for information professionals to take a keener interest in Wikipedia, with an eye to helping include accounts of documented historical perspectives that are ignored by mainstream historiographical traditions.;,citation_author=Brendan Luyt;,citation_publication_date=2011;,citation_cover_date=2011;,citation_year=2011;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/asi.21531;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1002/asi.21531;,citation_issn=1532-2890;,citation_volume=62;,citation_journal_title=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Two Wikipedias in Bhutan: Problems and solutions for knowledge equity in the digital age;,citation_abstract=The growing influence of English Wikipedia as a provider of information has created powerful new gatekeepers and publishing practices that determine not only what constitutes knowledge in the online world, but whose knowledge is privileged. The structural inequalities of the offline world are being reproduced online, creating new sites for information imperialism. Research shows western contributors are overwriting local knowledge, perpetuating western narratives, and presenting cultures through an outsider lens, resulting in subtle and not so subtle forms of hegemonic cultural dominance. Nonetheless, Wikipedias have multi-media capabilities, which can be utilized by oral cultures as well as providing new asynchronous online meeting places where communities can continue their social imaginings. This paper considers the impacts of English Wikipedia on global knowledge equity and cognitive justice. It analyzes two articles about Bhutanese culture to demonstrate the risks of dilution brought by western ontological expansiveness, and argues that, by contrast, the Dzongkha Wikipedia offers an online space mostly inaccessible to outsiders, and thus a bulwark where the community can continue its cultural conversations in ways not possible before Web 2.0 technologies.;,citation_author=Bunty Avieson;,citation_publication_date=2022-09;,citation_cover_date=2022-09;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1080/01292986.2021.1937248;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1080/01292986.2021.1937248;,citation_issn=0129-2986;,citation_volume=32;,citation_journal_title=Asian Journal of Communication;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=User-Generated Content Shapes Judicial Reasoning: Evidence From a Randomized Control Trial on Wikipedia;,citation_abstract=Legal professionals have access to many different sources of knowledge, including user-generated Wikipedia articles that summarize previous judicial decisions (i.e., precedents). While these Wikipedia articles are easily accessible, they have unknown provenance and reliability and therefore using them in professional settings is problematic. Nevertheless, Wikipedia articles influence legal judgments, as we show using a randomized control trial.We find that the presence of a Wikipedia article about Irish Supreme Court decisions makes it meaningfully more likely that the corresponding case will be cited as a precedent by judges in subsequent decisions. The language used in the Wikipedia article also influences the language used in judgments. These effects are only present for citations by the High Court, not for the higher levels of the judiciary (Court of Appeal and Supreme Court). Since the High Court faces higher caseloads, this may indicate that settings with greater time pressures encourage greater reliance on Wikipedia.Our results add to the growing recognition that Wikipedia and other frequently-accessed sources of user-generated content have profound effects on important social outcomes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Gender Divide in Wikipedia: Quantifying and Assessing the Impact of Two Feminist Interventions;,citation_abstract=Wikipedia has a well-known gender divide affecting its biographical content. This bias not only shapes social perceptions of knowledge, but it can also propagate beyond the platform as its contents are leveraged to correct misinformation, train machine-learning tools, and enhance search engine results. What happens when feminist movements intervene to try to close existing gaps? Through a quantitative analysis of over 11,000 Wikipedia articles, we provide an evaluation of two popular feminist interventions designed to counteract gender inequality within digital information projects. We find that the interventions are successful at adding content about women that would otherwise be missing, but they are less successful at addressing structural biases that limit the visibility of that content. This leads us to argue for a more granular and cumulative analysis of gender gaps in collaborative environments. We also discuss the implications for future scholarship on digital inequalities.;,citation_author=Isabelle Langrock;,citation_author=Sandra González-Bailón;,citation_publication_date=2022-06;,citation_cover_date=2022-06;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1093/joc/jqac004;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1093/joc/jqac004;,citation_issn=0021-9916;,citation_volume=72;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Communication;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Controlled Analyses of Social Biases in Wikipedia Bios;,citation_abstract=Social biases on Wikipedia, a widely-read global platform, could greatly influence public opinion. While prior research has examined man/woman gender bias in biography articles, possible influences of other demographic attributes limit conclusions. In this work, we present a methodology for analyzing Wikipedia pages about people that isolates dimensions of interest (e.g., gender), from other attributes (e.g., occupation). Given a target corpus for analysis (e.g. biographies about women), we present a method for constructing a comparison corpus that matches the target corpus in as many attributes as possible, except the target one. We develop evaluation metrics to measure how well the comparison corpus aligns with the target corpus and then examine how articles about gender and racial minorities (cis. women, non-binary people, transgender women, and transgender men; African American, Asian American, and Hispanic/Latinx American people) differ from other articles. In addition to identifying suspect social biases, our results show that failing to control for covariates can result in different conclusions and veil biases. Our contributions include methodology that facilitates further analyses of bias in Wikipedia articles, findings that can aid Wikipedia editors in reducing biases, and a framework and evaluation metrics to guide future work in this area.;,citation_author=Anjalie Field;,citation_author=Chan Young Park;,citation_author=Kevin Z.

Anyone with access to the Web is able to play a part on Wikipedia, an open and free encyclopedia, and arguably one of the primary sources of knowledge on the Web. In this paper, we study gender bias in Wikipedia in terms of how women and men are characterized in their biographies. To do so, we analyze biographical content in three aspects: meta-data, language, and network structure. Our results show that, indeed, there are differences in characterization and structure. Some of these differences are reflected from the off-line world documented by Wikipedia, but other differences can be attributed to gender bias in Wikipedia content. We contextualize these differences in social theory and discuss their implications for Wikipedia policy.;,citation_author=Eduardo Graells-Garrido;,citation_author=Mounia Lalmas;,citation_author=Filippo Menczer;,citation_publication_date=2015-08;,citation_cover_date=2015-08;,citation_year=2015;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1145/2700171.2791036;,citation_doi=10.1145/2700171.2791036;,citation_isbn=978-1-4503-3395-5;,citation_conference_title=Proceedings of the 26th ACM Conference on Hypertext &amp;amp;amp; Social Media;,citation_conference=Association for Computing Machinery;,citation_series_title=HT ’15;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Big Data and the brave new world of social media research;,citation_abstract=The recent Facebook study about emotional contagion has generated a high-profile debate about the ethical and social issues in Big Data research. These issues are not unprecedented, but the debate highlighted that, in focusing on research ethics and the legal issues about this type of research, an important larger picture is overlooked about the extent to which free will is compatible with the growth of deterministic scientific knowledge, and how Big Data research has become central to this growth of knowledge. After discussing the ?emotional contagion study? as an illustration, these larger issues about Big Data and scientific knowledge are addressed by providing definitions of data, Big Data and of how scientific knowledge changes the human-made environment. Against this background, it will be possible to examine why the uses of data-driven analyses of human behaviour in particular have recently experienced rapid growth. The essay then goes on to discuss the distinction between basic scientific research as against applied research, a distinction which, it is argued, is necessary to understand the quite different implications in the context of scientific as opposed to applied research. Further, it is important to recognize that Big Data analyses are both enabled and constrained by the nature of data sources available. Big Data research is bound to become more widespread, and this will require more awareness on the part of data scientists, policymakers and a wider public about its contexts and often unintended consequences.;,citation_author=Ralph Schroeder;,citation_publication_date=2014-07;,citation_cover_date=2014-07;,citation_year=2014;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951714563194;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1177/2053951714563194;,citation_issn=2053-9517;,citation_volume=1;,citation_journal_title=Big Data &amp;amp;amp; Society;">

Such projects, and the edit-a-thons that continue to be convened in Wadewitz’s honour, help to reconcile the imbalance and simultaneously present pedagogical opportunities. Drawing upon scholarly literature, this paper also illustrates how Wikipedia editing supports and reinforces the principles of both academic and public writing and represents an open and sustainable platform for formative and summative assessment.

In this commentary, we propose moving the research focus beyond bias-oriented framings by adopting a power-aware perspective to &amp;amp;amp;quot;study up&amp;quot; ML datasets. This means accounting for historical inequities, labor conditions, and epistemological standpoints inscribed in data. We draw on HCI and CSCW work to support our argument, critically analyze previous research, and point at two co-existing lines of work within our research community \,—\,one bias-centered, the other power-aware. We highlight the need for dialogue and cooperation in three areas: data quality, data work, and data documentation. In the first area, we argue that reducing societal problems to &quot;bias&quot; misses the context-based nature of data. In the second one, we highlight the corporate forces and market imperatives involved in the labor of data workers that subsequently shape ML datasets.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The discovery of “unpaid work”: The social consequences of the expansion of “work”;,citation_abstract=This paper questions the dichotomy of work/nonwork. It examines the way in which the category of work was expanded by feminists and economists to include much domestic activity, and considers some of the consequences of this expansion. It argues that the discovery of unpaid &amp;amp;amp;quot;work&amp;quot; involved an uncritical application and validation of a concept of work abstracted from a model of commodity producing wage labor in manufacturing. However, this concept excludes much of what is distinctive about domestic activities, such as their caring and self-fulfilling aspects. Inequality between households has become a conduit for the construction of needs in a form in which &quot;work,&quot; and in particular work for money, is needed to satisfy them. Some consequences of this tendency are examined together with the policy concerns which would need to be addressed in order to mitigate its deleterious effects. The development of a feminist economics which transcends the polarization of life into &quot;work&quot; and &quot;nonwork&quot; is argued to be vital in this process.;,citation_author=Susan Himmelweit;,citation_publication_date=1995-07;,citation_cover_date=1995-07;,citation_year=1995;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/714042229;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1080/714042229;,citation_issn=1354-5701, 1466-4372;,citation_volume=1;,citation_journal_title=Feminist Economics;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The sounds of silence in Australian collective memory and popular counter-narratives (Los sonidos del silencio en la memoria colectiva australiana y en los relatos alternativos populares);,citation_abstract=In 1968, the Australian anthropologist W. E. H. Stanner famously articulated that the nation’s history had been wracked by a “great Australian silence” with regard to the recognition of Indigenous experience. Australia’s sense of its past, he argued, its very collective memory, had been built on a state of forgetting. Beyond that disciplinary silence, however, important historical “noise” was being made about Indigenous history. Popular historical fiction and poetry, Indigenous family histories and forms of popular protest all offered important counter-narratives to that formal silence from the History discipline. Scholarship in the fields of anthropology and archaeology further pressed against the silences and silencing of Australian History. This paper uses the idea of silence to complicate historiographical space in Australia. By contemplating formal History texts, vernacular historical accounts and history-making beyond the discipline, it seeks to extend our understandings of national historiographies and historical knowledge.;,citation_author=Anna Clark;,citation_publication_date=2020-07;,citation_cover_date=2020-07;,citation_year=2020;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1080/02103702.2020.1771966;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1080/02103702.2020.1771966;,citation_issn=0210-3702;,citation_volume=43;,citation_journal_title=Journal for the Study of Education and Development;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Wikipedia’s Intentional Distortion of the History of the Holocaust;,citation_abstract=This essay uncovers the systematic, intentional distortion of Holocaust history on the English-language Wikipedia, the world’s largest encyclopedia. In the last decade, a group of committed Wikipedia editors have been promoting a skewed version of history on Wikipedia, one touted by right-wing Polish nationalists, which whitewashes the role of Polish society in the Holocaust and bolsters stereotypes about Jews. Due to this group’s zealous handiwork, Wikipedia’s articles on the Holocaust in Poland minimize Polish antisemitism, exaggerate the Poles’ role in saving Jews, insinuate that most Jews supported Communism and conspired with Communists to betray Poles (Żydokomuna or Judeo–Bolshevism), blame Jews for their own persecution, and inflate Jewish collaboration with the Nazis. To explain how distortionist editors have succeeded in imposing this narrative, despite the efforts of opposing editors to correct it, we employ an innovative methodology. We examine 25 public-facing Wikipedia articles and nearly 300 of Wikipedia’s back pages, including talk pages, noticeboards, and arbitration cases.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Organization in the crowd: Peer production in large-scale networked protests;,citation_abstract=How is crowd organization produced? How are crowd-enabled networks activated, structured, and maintained in the absence of recognized leaders, common goals, or conventional organization, issue framing, and action coordination? We develop an analytical framework for examining the organizational processes of crowd-enabled connective action such as was found in the Arab Spring, the 15-M in Spain, and Occupy Wall Street. The analysis points to three elemental modes of peer production that operate together to create organization in crowds: the production, curation, and dynamic integration of various types of information content and other resources that become distributed and utilized across the crowd. Whereas other peer-production communities such as open-source software developers or Wikipedia typically evolve more highly structured participation environments, crowds create organization through packaging these elemental peer-production mechanisms to achieve various kinds of work. The workings of these “production packages” are illustrated with a theory-driven analysis of Twitter data from the 2011–2012 US Occupy movement, using an archive of some 60 million tweets. This analysis shows how the Occupy crowd produced various organizational routines, and how the different production mechanisms were nested in each other to create relatively complex organizational results.;,citation_author=W.

Have the ways we understand the past and the future—and their relationship to the present—been reordered? The past, it seems, has returned with a vengeance: as aggressive nostalgia, as traumatic memory, or as atavistic origin narratives rooted in nation, race, or tribe. The future, meanwhile, has lost its utopian glamor, with the belief in progress and hope for a better future eroded by fears of ecological collapse. In this provocative book, Aleida Assmann argues that the apparently solid moorings of our temporal orientation have collapsed within the span of a generation. To understand this profound cultural crisis, she reconstructs the rise and fall of what she calls &amp;amp;amp;quot;time regime of modernity&amp;quot; that underpins notions of modernization and progress, a shared understanding that is now under threat. Is Time Out of Joint? assesses the deep change in the temporality of modern Western culture as it relates to our historical experience, historical theory, and our life-world of shared experience, explaining what we have both gained and lost during this profound transformation.;,citation_author=Aleida Assmann;,citation_publication_date=2020;,citation_cover_date=2020;,citation_year=2020;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/uts/detail.action?docID=5964894;,citation_isbn=978-1-5017-4245-3;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Beyond opening up the black box: Investigating the role of algorithmic systems in Wikipedian organizational culture;,citation_abstract=Scholars and practitioners across domains are increasingly concerned with algorithmic transparency and opacity, interrogating the values and assumptions embedded in automated, black-boxed systems, particularly in user-generated content platforms. I report from an ethnography of infrastructure in Wikipedia to discuss an often understudied aspect of this topic: the local, contextual, learned expertise involved in participating in a highly automated social–technical environment. Today, the organizational culture of Wikipedia is deeply intertwined with various data-driven algorithmic systems, which Wikipedians rely on to help manage and govern the “‘anyone can edit’” encyclopedia at a massive scale. These bots, scripts, tools, plugins, and dashboards make Wikipedia more efficient for those who know how to work with them, but like all organizational culture, newcomers must learn them if they want to fully participate. I illustrate how cultural and organizational expertise is enacted around algorithmic agents by discussing two autoethnographic vignettes, which relate my personal experience as a veteran in Wikipedia. I present thick descriptions of how governance and gatekeeping practices are articulated through and in alignment with these automated infrastructures. Over the past 15 years, Wikipedian veterans and administrators have made specific decisions to support administrative and editorial workflows with automation in particular ways and not others. I use these cases of Wikipedia’s bot-supported bureaucracy to discuss several issues in the fields of critical algorithms studies; critical data studies; and fairness, accountability, and transparency in machine learning—most principally arguing that scholarship and practice must go beyond trying to “‘open up the black box’” of such systems and also examine sociocultural processes like newcomer socialization.;,citation_author=R Stuart Geiger;,citation_publication_date=2017-12;,citation_cover_date=2017-12;,citation_year=2017;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2053951717730735;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1177/2053951717730735;,citation_issn=2053-9517, 2053-9517;,citation_volume=4;,citation_journal_title=Big Data &amp;amp;amp; Society;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Old and New of Digital History;,citation_abstract=This article reflects on the expectations and changes that digital technologies have brought to history, activities that are increasingly codified as digital history. Because of the breadth of digital technologies and communicative media, the contours of a digital history are still unclear, so I frame my discussion with two potential narratives that begin from different ideas that emerged from World War II weapons research. One narrative begins with Roberto Busa and the application of a computer to find concordances in the writings of Saint Thomas Aquinas. The emphasis here is on the application of computer technologies to the practice of history. The second narrative begins with Vannevar Bush’s essay “As We May Think” and focuses on digital technologies as a key element in an information system. This beginning invites a parallel between inscription technologies (especially the movable-type press) and knowledge systems. Both narratives imbibe the modern faith in technology to improve; the “new” is better, but the latter better involves humans and societies. Despite important differences between them, both narratives lead to an inquiry into the foundations of our modern knowledge system. In the case of history, the question is whether a knowledge system that was developed in the nineteenth century and designed to encompass and order the world into one system is still apposite in our digital world. I close by suggesting that one such presumption that needs to be reconsidered is the idea of the past as a prior and distant time-form. A shift from “the past” to “pasts” opens history to a broader field of previous happenings and a reconsideration of chronological time, of change, and to other modes of transmission, such as storytelling.;,citation_author=Stefan Tanaka;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hith.12284;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1111/hith.12284;,citation_issn=1468-2303;,citation_volume=61;,citation_journal_title=History and Theory;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Composing History for the Web: Digital Reformulation of Narrative, Evidence, and Context;,citation_abstract=I recently published A New Vision for Islamic Pasts and Futures, a digital book that presents a new way to understand Islam. This article describes the process and conceptual work that went into designing the book’s interface. It emphasizes that hypertext enabled through digital means is not intrinsically more dynamic than print since work in both forms requires equally intensive hermeneutical effort. However, the digital realm provides a more expansive spectrum of tools to formulate concepts and to build on them. Digital presentation can be integrated into processes of theorizing, describing, and advocating that form the core of scholarship in the humanities. The article focuses on three areas—narrative, evidence, and context—that are central to modern historical work. My book’s interface demonstrates that web capabilities are compositional tools whose deployment should be mulled over in a manner similar to how authors treat writing and editing. Moreover, we should take account of the quotidian fact that, in our environment, information and knowledge reach us extensively via computer-based mediation. Whether in books or in articles, academic work is assimilated through piecemeal delivery rather than bound volumes. Instead of romanticizing traditional forms whose import may be diminishing, historians and other humanities scholars can create new arguments by being attentive to the web’s capabilities and to the current social conditions of possibility pertaining to the circulation of knowledge. Facility with digital composition can then feed back into all forms of humanistic thinking and writing.;,citation_author=Shahzad Bashir;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hith.12275;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1111/hith.12275;,citation_issn=1468-2303;,citation_volume=61;,citation_journal_title=History and Theory;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Historical Practice in the Era of Digital History;,citation_abstract=The current digital historical moment is an opportunity to formulate a new theory of historical practice. Our field’s long-standing passive reliance on the widespread explanation of historical practice as deriving information from “primary sources” is unhelpful, incoherent, misleading, and an active inhibition to new opportunities. Our reliance on an incoherent explanation means our students are not given a precise description of our historical practice but instead learn to imitate us by gradually adopting disciplinary norms conveyed through exemplary models and the critique of work performed. Furthermore, our reliance on a misleading explanation of method means we lack a common terminology with which we all can coherently explain to our peers what we actually do. We know this, and yet we have provided no alternative. The current moment offers an opportunity to provide a theory of the practice of history that encompasses contemporary, traditional, and even ancient historical methods: capturing sources, producing data, and creating facts. Wide acceptance and implementation of a sources-data-facts model of historical practice will accelerate student understanding, improve communication with other disciplines, erase the apparent distinction between (so-called) analog and digital history, and provide a framework for the publication of historical data as a valuable end in and of itself.;,citation_author=Jesse W.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=History as Antidote: The Argument for Documentation in Digital History;,citation_abstract=The ephemeral nature of computer-enabled historical work is a well-documented concern within the field of history. The quick pace of technological change often renders digital scholarship obsolete, which in turn encourages historians to retreat to the stable and durable comfort of print, even as digital methodologies enrich our research and expand the audience for it. What has been missing so far in the conversation about digital history is a clear understanding of how it differs from traditional historical products, what can be gained from it, and how we might document the work undertaken using these machine-based methodologies. Because it is best understood as a process rather than as a product, digital history must have a history of its own to tether it to the scholarly community and to ensure that it endures past the active phase of any project. This article argues that digital historians should catalog their work using a normalized template following the Digital Documentation Process, a guide for producing documentation that is suitable for computer-based historical scholarship and tailored to its specific parameters. Self-documentation is beneficial to those who create digital history and those who consume it. It is urgent to establish a field-wide expectation that digital history will be consistently documented as a matter of course, lest we lose scholarship that has already been produced and forgo the enormous opportunities that computer-enabled methodologies offer to historians.;,citation_author=Laura K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Opening the Black Box of Interpretation: Digital History Practices as Models of Knowledge;,citation_abstract=Digital history is more than just the implementation of algorithmic and other data practices in the practice of history writing. It places our discipline under a microscope and enables us to focus in on what history writing is in the first place: writing about the past under specific social and societal conditions. This article argues for a closer look at the traditions of history writing in order to understand its principles and to determine what the digital condition contributes to historiography. Does the work of historians actually change in principle, or does digital history instead reflect the digital condition under which we operate? The article begins with a reflection on the works of Wilhelm Dilthey and Michel de Certeau to discuss how the society in which the historian writes influences the practices of interpretation. The article then presents what can be understood as the digital condition of our present societies and shows how algorithms function as “black boxes” that influence our social interactions, communication, and understanding of the world. The article’s third part brings together the earlier discussions of practices of history writing and the digital condition in order to examine the role of modeling for knowledge production in the sciences and the humanities. The closing argument then focuses on the use of visualizations in digital history as an example of the operational use of models of knowledge in opening the “black box” of interpretation.;,citation_author=Silke Schwandt;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hith.12281;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1111/hith.12281;,citation_issn=1468-2303;,citation_volume=61;,citation_journal_title=History and Theory;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Properties of Digital History;,citation_abstract=This article offers a definition of digital history that focuses on the core affordances of the personal computer and the process by which those properties come to be exploited. I begin by outlining the two properties of computers that I argue define digital history: they process data and (as Janet H. Murray noted) provide an immersive and interactive medium. I then examine how digital historians in the United States have employed those affordances. That process has proceeded unevenly, with computers having been used as a medium before they were employed to process data, and has produced additive forms—digital archives, digital public history, data analysis published in print—that rely on existing formats rather than on the affordances of computers. While such forms are a necessary step toward a more fully realized digital history, their prevalence suggests that it will take some time for that process to play out. The final section looks to recently published and forthcoming long-form digital arguments for the direction of that development. Examples from Stanford University Press’s Digital Projects series point to some of the ways that the data analysis and the immersive and interactive medium of the computer might be combined.;,citation_author=Stephen Robertson;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hith.12286;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1111/hith.12286;,citation_issn=1468-2303;,citation_volume=61;,citation_journal_title=History and Theory;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Toward the Recognition of Artificial History Makers;,citation_abstract=Artificial intelligence is a historical discipline. This does not simply mean that its history can be written. It is historical on account of its recursive basis for action: its systems turn to prior beliefs—often through multiple steps or layers—to make recommendations for the present or predictions for the future. Using the two rooms approach of Alan Turing’s imitation game, I highlight the potential for machine and human histories to be recognized via at least the idea of weak artificial intelligence. This recognition illuminates the mixed nature of the logic of history, combining deductions and endoxa. Finally, I note that illuminating and exploring this mixed logic of history signals a turn to historiographical metaphysics with Aristotelian features and, thus, the recognition of histories by professional historians as only part of a historiographical world. This signals that the recognition of machine and human history makers does not simply turn on the acknowledgement of imitation.;,citation_author=Marnie Hughes-Warrington;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hith.12278;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1111/hith.12278;,citation_issn=1468-2303;,citation_volume=61;,citation_journal_title=History and Theory;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Digital Doping for Historians: Can History, Memory, and Historical Theory Be Rendered Artificially In℡ligent?;,citation_abstract=Artificial intelligence is making history, literally. Machine learning tools are playing a key role in crafting images and stories about the past in popular culture. AI has probably also already invaded the history classroom. Large language models such as GPT-3 are able to generate compelling, non-plagiarized texts in response to simple natural language inputs, thus providing students with an opportunity to produce high-quality written assignments with minimum effort. In a similar vein, tools like GPT-3 are likely to revolutionize historical studies, enabling historians and other professionals who deal in texts to rely on AI-generated intermediate work products, such as accurate translations, summaries, and chronologies. But present-day large language models fail at key tasks that historians hold in high regard. They are structurally incapable of telling the truth and tracking pieces of information through layers of texts. What’s more, they lack ethical self-reflexivity. Therefore, for the time being, the writing of academic history will require human agency. But for historical theorists, large language models might offer an opportunity to test basic hypotheses about the nature of historical writing. Historical theorists can, for instance, have customized large language models write a series of descriptive, narrative, and assertive histories about the same events, thereby enabling them to explore the precise relation between description, narration, and argumentation in historical writing. In short, with specifically designed large language models, historical theorists can run the kinds of large-scale writing experiments that they could never put into practice with real historians.;,citation_author=Wulf Kansteiner;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hith.12282;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1111/hith.12282;,citation_issn=1468-2303;,citation_volume=61;,citation_journal_title=History and Theory;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Implicated Gaming: Choice and Complicity in Ludic Holocaust Memory;,citation_abstract=Holocaust memorial sites and institutions have begun to embrace new media and digital technologies as methods of communication, public engagement, and memorialization. Despite increasing numbers of interactive digital media projects focused on Holocaust education, there is a significant gulf between the topics addressed by digital Holocaust works and those conceptualized and studied at a higher level in scholarly Holocaust literature. Most notably, challenging questions regarding the categories of bystandership, complicity, and perpetration are largely ignored in favor of traditional victim-focused narratives. I suggest that, in their eagerness to adopt virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR) technologies, digital Holocaust memory projects have neglected the significant potential of nonimmersive video games to address questions regarding bystandership and complicity. By moving away from the perceptual immersion of VR and toward the ludic and simulative arguments of video games, digitally interactive Holocaust projects may be able to lessen the risks of over-immersion and retraumatization that are antithetical to critical historical thinking and understanding. This article examines the 2013 game Papers, Please as an example of how video games can present sophisticated arguments about human agency, bystandership, and complicity. By placing players in a historical problem space laden with impossible moral choices, Papers, Please demonstrates the systemic forces that structure human behavior under extreme, violent, and authoritarian conditions. I argue that Holocaust-based ludic digital media modeled after Papers, Please could explore bystandership and complicity in similarly nuanced and powerful ways, potentially touching on academic Holocaust concepts such as the “choiceless choices” of “the gray zone.” Addressing these topics in ludic historical media could help to bridge the gap between popular and scholarly understandings of the Holocaust in the twenty-first century.;,citation_author=Tamika Glouftsis;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hith.12277;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1111/hith.12277;,citation_issn=1468-2303;,citation_volume=61;,citation_journal_title=History and Theory;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Historical Futures;,citation_abstract=This article outlines the agenda of a collective research project that aims to explore modalities of historical futures that constitute our current historical condition. To present the collective work adequately, we have teamed up with History and Theory and initiated a long-term serial publishing experiment. In the coming years, each issue of the journal will feature contributions to this research endeavor. In our project-opening piece, we briefly introduce the experiment and the premises of the collective research agenda. We begin by recounting the many ways in which increasingly towering novel future prospects have begun to capture the scholarly world’s attention across disciplinary boundaries. We then introduce the notion of historical futures. Crediting theoretical inspirations and paying intellectual debts to conceptual relatives, we define “historical futures” as the plurality of transitional relations between apprehensions of the past and anticipated futures. At the core of the article, we formulate our call for a collective investigation of modalities of historical futures and sketch three basic sets of concerns that the explorative works in this experiment may address: kinds of transitions from past to futures, kinds of anticipatory practices, and kinds of registers as interpretive tools that position such practices on a variety of spectrums between two poles (for instance, a value register with the poles of catastrophic and redemptive futures).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Entangled Memory: Toward a Third Wave in Memory Studies;,citation_abstract=This essay takes up the call for a “third phase” in memory studies and makes theoretical and methodological suggestions for its further development. Starting from an understanding of memory that centers on memory’s temporality, its relation to language, and its quality as a social action, the essay puts forward the concept of “entangled memory.” On a theoretical level, it brings to the fore the entangledness of acts of remembering. In a synchronic perspective, memory’s entangledness is presented as twofold. Every act of remembering inscribes an individual in multiple social frames. This polyphony entails the simultaneous existence of concurrent interpretations of the past. In a diachronic perspective, memory is entangled in the dynamic relation between single acts of remembering and changing mnemonic patterns. Memory scholars therefore uncover boundless cross-referential configurations. Wishing to enhance the dialogue between the theoretical and the empirical parts of memory studies, we propose four devices that serve as a heuristic in the study of memory’s entanglement: chronology against time, conflict, generations, and self-reflexivity. Current debates on European memory permit us to explore the possible benefits that the concept of entangled memory carries for memory studies.;,citation_author=Gregor Feindt;,citation_author=Félix Krawatzek;,citation_author=Daniela Mehler;,citation_author=Friedemann Pes℡;,citation_author=Rieke Trimçev;,citation_publication_date=2014;,citation_cover_date=2014;,citation_year=2014;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hith.10693;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1111/hith.10693;,citation_issn=1468-2303;,citation_volume=53;,citation_journal_title=History and Theory;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Finding Meaning in Memory: A Methodological Critique of Collective Memory Studies;,citation_abstract=The memory wave in the humanities has contributed to the impressive revival of cultural history, but the success of memory studies has not been accompanied by significant conceptual and methodological advances in the research of collective memory processes. Most studies on memory focus on the representation of specific events within particular chronological, geographical, and media settings without reflecting on the audiences of the representations in question. As a result, the wealth of new insights into past and present historical cultures cannot be linked conclusively to specific social collectives and their historical consciousness. This methodological problem is even enhanced by the metaphorical use of psychological and neurological terminology, which misrepresents the social dynamics of collective memory as an effect and extension of individual, autobiographical memory. Some of these shortcomings can be addressed through the extensive contextualization of specific strategies of representation, which links facts of representation with facts of reception. As a result, the history of collective memory would be recast as a complex process of cultural production and consumption that acknowledges the persistence of cultural traditions as well as the ingenuity of memory makers and the subversive interests of memory consumers. The negotiations among these three different historical agents create the rules of engagement in the competitive arena of memory politics, and the reconstruction of these negotiations helps us distinguish among the abundance of failed collective memory initiatives on the one hand and the few cases of successful collective memory construction on the other. For this purpose, collective memory studies should adopt the methods of communication and media studies, especially with regard to media reception, and continue to use a wide range of interpretive tools from traditional historiography to poststructural approaches. From the perspective of collective memory studies, these two traditions are closely related and mutually beneficial, rather than mutually exclusive, ways of analyzing historical cultures.;,citation_author=Wulf Kansteiner;,citation_publication_date=2002;,citation_cover_date=2002;,citation_year=2002;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/0018-2656.00198;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1111/0018-2656.00198;,citation_issn=1468-2303;,citation_volume=41;,citation_journal_title=History and Theory;">

Towards a sociology of technology and time;,citation_abstract=Assumptions about the pace of life speeding up abound in contemporary social theory. While many factors are contributing to this phenomenon, information and communication technologies are seen as the main drivers. This article considers the way social theorists analyse the concepts of time and speed and then examines how these claims might be assessed in the light of empirical research. Such research shows that time compression has multiple dimensions, and that the effect of digital devices like the mobile phone is not simply one of acceleration. In particular, I suggest that the social studies of technology offers a richer analysis of the reciprocal relationship between technological innovation and changing time practices. My argument is that while the hitherto neglected temporal dimension in sociological theory is now being addressed, there is an urgent need for increased dialogue to connect social theory with detailed empirical studies.

We explore this integration of fact and value in an unexpected setting: the “talk pages” of the online encyclopedia Wikipedia in which discussions of article creation are recorded. Our analysis of these discussions draws on Nelson Goodman’s Ways of Worldmaking, another classic on the social construction of reality, which catalogues strategies for producing a worldview. We utilize Goodman’s theories in four cases of Wikipedia article creation – two histories, “Iraq War” and “Afghanistan War,” and two biographies, “George W.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Collaboratively constructed contradictory accounts: Online organizational narratives;,citation_abstract=Based on a mixed-method case study of online communication about the Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, this article argues that online communication plays out as a centrifugal narration process with centripetal consequences. Through a content analysis of communication about Novo Nordisk, three dominant online meaning constructions that present themselves as narratives are identified and their convergence into one overarching meta-narrative is identified. The meta-narrative of Novo Nordisk as the ruthlessly profit-seeking socially responsible heavenly work place is made up of the three interrelated, yet disparate tales about Novo Nordisk as (1) a socially responsible organization, engaged in society at large; (2) an organization primarily concerned with fulfilling its own objectives – profit maximization; and (3) a great and employee-centred workplace. The article then discusses the theoretical and methodological implications of the empirical findings. It is argued that although the findings are not in themselves surprising, they adequately reflect that online meaning formation is, indeed, a collaborative process in which centrifugal forces have centripetal consequences. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the chosen mixed-method case study successfully navigates the dilemma of studying online collaborative processes through the traces they leave behind.;,citation_author=Ib Tunby Gulbrandsen;,citation_author=Sine Nørholm Just;,citation_publication_date=2013-07;,citation_cover_date=2013-07;,citation_year=2013;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0163443713485492;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1177/0163443713485492;,citation_issn=0163-4437;,citation_volume=35;,citation_journal_title=Media, Culture &amp;amp;amp; Society;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Browsing with Alexa: Interrogating the impact of voice assistants as web interfaces;,citation_abstract=Voice assistants such as Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant have recently been the subject of lively debates in regard to issues such as artificial intelligence, surveillance, gender stereotypes, and privacy. Less attention, however, has been given to the fact that voice assistants are also web interfaces that might impact on how the web is accessed, understood and employed by users. This article aims to advance work in this context by identifying a range of issues that should spark additional reflections and discussions within communication and media studies and related fields. In particular, the article focuses on three key issues that have to do with long-standing discussions about the social and political impact of the internet: the role of web platforms in shaping information access, the relationship between production and consumption online, and the role of affect in informing engagement with web resources. Considering these issues in regard to voice assistants not only helps contextualize these technologies within existing debates in communication and media studies, but also highlights that voice assistants pose novel questions to internet research, challenging assumptions of what the web looks like as speech becomes one of the key ways to access resources and information online.;,citation_author=Simone Natale;,citation_author=Henry Cooke;,citation_publication_date=2021-09;,citation_cover_date=2021-09;,citation_year=2021;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0163443720983295;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1177/0163443720983295;,citation_issn=0163-4437;,citation_volume=43;,citation_journal_title=Media, Culture &amp;amp;amp; Society;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Querying the Internet as a mnemonic practice: How search engines mediate four types of past events in Russia;,citation_abstract=In the digital memories literature, the practice of searching for information – one of the most frequent online activities worldwide – has received comparatively little attention. To fill the gap, this exploratory study asks how search engines affect the representations of the past that they produce in query results. Designed as a single revelatory case study, with a focus on Russia, this article delineates a typology of four types of memory events based on four types of websites dominating search results. For each type of event, we discuss recurring locations and mechanisms of power struggles over competing memory narratives. We conclude that within Russia’s authoritarian context, the mnemonic practice of Internet searching tends to reproduce and reinforce the dominant narratives supported by the ruling elites. Search engine companies are thus only one of several powerful institutions that constitute the social framework within which querying the Internet is pursued as a mnemonic practice. Others include mass media, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and online encyclopaedias.;,citation_author=Andrei Zavadski;,citation_author=Florian Toepfl;,citation_publication_date=2019-01;,citation_cover_date=2019-01;,citation_year=2019;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0163443718764565;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1177/0163443718764565;,citation_issn=0163-4437;,citation_volume=41;,citation_journal_title=Media, Culture &amp;amp;amp; Society;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Politics of Real-time: A Device Perspective on Social Media Platforms and Search Engines;,citation_abstract=This paper enquires into the politics of real-time in online media. It suggests that real-time cannot be accounted for as a universal temporal frame in which events happen, but explores the making of real-time from a device perspective focusing on the temporalities of platforms. Based on an empirical study exploring the pace at which various online media produce new content, we trace the different rhythms, patterns or tempos created by the interplay of devices, users? web activities and issues. What emerges are distinct forms of ?realtimeness? which are not external from but specific to devices, organized through socio-technical arrangements and practices of use. Realtimeness thus unflattens more general accounts of the real-time web and research, and draws attention to the agencies built into specific platform temporalities and the political economies of making real-time.;,citation_author=Esther Weltevrede;,citation_author=Anne Helmond;,citation_author=Carolin Gerlitz;,citation_publication_date=2014-11;,citation_cover_date=2014-11;,citation_year=2014;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0263276414537318;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1177/0263276414537318;,citation_issn=0263-2764;,citation_volume=31;,citation_journal_title=Theory, Culture &amp;amp;amp; Society;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Summa Technologiae;,citation_abstract=The Polish writer Stanislaw Lem is best known to English-speaking readers as the author of the 1961 science fiction novel Solaris, adapted into a meditative film by Andrei Tarkovsky in 1972 and remade in 2002 by Steven Soderbergh. Throughout his writings, comprising dozens of science fiction novels and short stories, Lem offered deeply philosophical and bitingly satirical reflections on the limitations of both science and humanity. In Summa Technologiae–his major work of nonfiction, first published in 1964 and now available in English for the first time–Lem produced an engaging and caustically logical philosophical treatise about human and nonhuman life in its past, present, and future forms. After five decades Summa Technologiae has lost none of its intellectual or critical significance. Indeed, many of Lem’s conjectures about future technologies have now come true: from artificial intelligence, bionics, and nanotechnology to the dangers of information overload, the concept underlying Internet search engines, and the idea of virtual reality. More important for its continued relevance, however, is Lem’s rigorous investigation into the parallel development of biological and technical evolution and his conclusion that technology will outlive humanity. Preceding Richard Dawkins’s understanding of evolution as a blind watchmaker by more than two decades, Lem posits evolution as opportunistic, shortsighted, extravagant, and illogical. Strikingly original and still timely, Summa Technologiae resonates with a wide range of contemporary debates about information and new media, the life sciences, and the emerging relationship between technology and humanity.;,citation_author=Stanisław Lem;,citation_author=Joanna Zylinska;,citation_publication_date=2013;,citation_cover_date=2013;,citation_year=2013;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/uts/detail.action?docID=1204686;,citation_isbn=978-0-8166-8903-3;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=It’s about time: Temporal structuring in organizations;,citation_abstract=This paper proposes the notion of temporal structuring as a way of understanding and studying time as an enacted phenomenon within organizations. It suggests that through their everyday action, actors produce and reproduce a variety of temporal structures which in turn shape the temporal rhythm and form of their ongoing practices. A focus on temporal structuring, combined with a practice perspective, allows the subjective-objective dichotomy that underlies much of the existing research on time in organizations to be bridged. After developing the notion of temporal structuring, the paper illustrates its use in the context of prior empirical study. The paper concludes by outlining some implications of temporal structuring for organizational research on time.;,citation_author=Wanda J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Rethinking time’s arrow: Bergson, Deleuze and the anthropology of time;,citation_abstract=Since the early 1970s, time has come to the fore as a constitutive element of social analysis in the guise of what I term here ’fluid time’. Anthropologists of multiple theoretical persuasions now take for granted that social life exists in ’time’, ’flow’, or ’flux’, and this temporal ontology is commonly accepted as a universal, if habitually unquestioned, attribute of human experience. Similarly, it underpins today’s dominant paradigm of ’processual’ analysis, in its many forms. Yet this concept is notably under-theorized, in keeping with a history of uneven study by social scientists of time. In this article I draw on anthropological approaches by Gell and Munn, and philosophical work by Bergson and Deleuze, to put forward a critical theorization. I then discuss its ramifications. Ultimately, I argue that this model points to a rapprochement between the anthropological study of time and history, sociality and temporality, and an enhanced role for temporal analysis in anthropological theory.;,citation_author=Matt Hodges;,citation_publication_date=2008-12;,citation_cover_date=2008-12;,citation_year=2008;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1463499608096646;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1177/1463499608096646;,citation_issn=1463-4996, 1741-2641;,citation_volume=8;,citation_journal_title=Anthropological Theory;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Past and the Present in the Present;,citation_abstract=This lecture starts by considering the old problem of how to account for social change theoretically and criticises some of the models used because, either they see the social process in terms used by the actors and so are unable to explain how it is that actors can change those terms, or they see the mechanisms of change as occurring in terms totally alien to the actors and so are unable to explain how these mechanisms can be transformed into meaningful action. The source of this problem is traced to Durkheim’s notion that cognition is socially determined. By contrast it is argued that those concepts which are moulded to social structure are not typical of knowledge but only found in ritual discourse, while the concepts using non-ritual discourse are constrained by such factors as the requirements of human action on nature. This means that there are terms available to actors by which the social order can be criticised since not all terms are moulded by it. Finally it is suggested that such notions as social structure only refer to ritualized folk statements about society, statements expressed in ritual discourse precisely with those concepts which are given as demonstrations of the theory of the cultural relativity of cognition. The Durkheimian correlation between society and cognition is merely a correlation of only certain ethical statements and certain aspects of cognition. This type of discourse is present in different types of society in varying amounts according to the degree of instituted hierarchy that these societies manifest. Anthropological theories about the conceptualisation of time are given as an example of the general argument.;,citation_author=Maurice Bloch;,citation_publication_date=1977;,citation_cover_date=1977;,citation_year=1977;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2800799;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.2307/2800799;,citation_issn=0025-1496;,citation_volume=12;,citation_journal_title=Man;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Resonance: A sociology of the relationship to the world;,citation_abstract=Summary: The pace of modern life is undoubtedly speeding up, yet this acceleration does not seem to have made us any happier or more content. If acceleration is the problem, then the solution, argues Hartmut Rosa in this major new work, lies in &amp;amp;amp;quot;resonance.&amp;quot; The quality of a human life cannot be measured simply in terms of resources, options, and moments of happiness; instead, we must consider our relationship to, or resonance with, the world. Applying his theory of resonance to many domains of human activity, Rosa describes the full spectrum of ways in which we establish our relationship to the world, from the act of breathing to the adoption of culturally distinct worldviews. He then turns to the realms of concrete experience and action - family and politics, work and sports, religion and art - in which we as late modern subjects seek out resonance. This task is proving ever more difficult as modernity’s logic of escalation is both cause and consequence of a distorted relationship to the world, at individual and collective levels. As Rosa shows, all the great crises of modern society - the environmental crisis, the crisis of democracy, the psychological crisis - can also be understood and analyzed in terms of resonance and our broken relationship to the world around us. Building on his now classic work on acceleration, Rosa’s new book is a major new contribution to the theory of modernity, showing how our problematic relation to the world is at the crux of some of the most pressing issues we face today. This bold renewal of critical theory for our times will be of great interest to students and scholars across the social sciences and humanities.;,citation_author=Hartmut Rosa;,citation_publication_date=2019;,citation_cover_date=2019;,citation_year=2019;,citation_isbn=978-1-5095-1989-7;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The politics of memory : An extended case study of the memory of crisis on Wikipedia;,citation_abstract=Numerous studies of memory on Wikipedia focus on edit wars (conflict between editors) relating to memories of war, atrocities and protests. There has been limited investigation of how other forms of social crisis are (re)constructed - including with regard to the interests, and involvement, of those groups more likely to be at risk of negative outcomes from crises. Processes of social and transitional justice (following crises) should include and empower these groups. Recent research on disaster risk reduction also suggests that memory (re)constructions contribute to preparation for future disasters, and it is important that the social choices interacting with disasters are considered as part of this. There is, however, limited evidence of how such issues are recognised and addressed in the (re)construction of diverse crises on Wikipedia - which feed into systems of automated forms of knowledge-making on the web. To address the above, an extended case study is developed on the (re)construction of a major pollution event (the Great Smog of London). Critical discourse analysis of intertextuality (connections between texts through hyperlinking and other shared patterning) is utilised to move from a focus on micro level practices to macro and meta level findings on the ordering of Wikipedia and its interactions with other institutions. Findings evidence a layered, self-referencing formation across texts, favouring the interests of established institutions and providing limited opportunity for marginalised groups to interact with sustained (re)constructions of the Great Smog. Comparison to a previous study of the constructed memory of a crisis (the London Bombings 2005) reveals dynamics across Wikipedia that lead to an emphasis on connecting (re)constructions to institutional traditions rather than the potential usefulness of such (re)construction for those at higher risk of negative outcomes arising from repeated crises.;,citation_author=Nina Margaret Schuller;,citation_publication_date=2023;,citation_cover_date=2023;,citation_year=2023;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/475212/;,citation_dissertation_institution=University of Southampton;">

Judith Halberstam proposes &amp;amp;amp;quot;low theory&amp;quot; as a mode of thinking and writing that operates at many different levels at once. Low theory is derived from eccentric archives. It runs the risk of not being taken seriously. It entails a willingness to fail and to lose one’s way, to pursue difficult questions about complicity, and to find counterintuitive forms of resistance. Tacking back and forth between high theory and low theory, high culture and low culture, Halberstam looks for the unexpected and subversive in popular culture, avant-garde performance, and queer art. She pays particular attention to animated children’s films, revealing narratives filled with unexpected encounters between the childish, the transformative, and the queer.

Indigenous researchers develop relationships with ideas in order to achieve enlightenment in the ceremony that is Indigenous research. Indigenous research is the ceremony of maintaining accountability to these relationships.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Autobiographical forgetting, social forgetting, and situated forgetting *: Forgetting in context;,citation_abstract=This chapter focuses on autobiographical memory, which relates to events and experiences in our personal past. Autobiographical memories are our recollections of specific episodes from the past. Research within different traditions and paradigms supports the view that certain kinds of memories are forgotten in apparently goal-directed ways. For instance, diary studies have suggested that whereas people are more likely to forget events about themselves that are negative rather than positive, they are more likely to forget events about others that are positive rather than negative. The retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF) paradigm developed by Anderson, Bjork, and Bjork models the kind of forgetting that occurs unconsciously in response to competition between memories, by practising some memories at the expense of others. RIF is considered an automatic, inevitable consequence of practising one piece of information at the expense of another.;,citation_author=Celia B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=’Is’ to ’Was’: Coordination and Commemoration in Posthumous Activity on Wikipedia Biographies;,citation_abstract=Following the deaths of notable people, Wikipedians incorporate this new knowledge by updating or creating biographical articles. Drawing on literature from death studies and peer production, we demonstrate how the creation of these &amp;amp;amp;quot;wiki-bituaries&amp;quot; requires complex coordination work and highlight processes of commemoration and memorialization within socio-technical systems. Using the corpus of 6,132 articles about people who died in 2012, we examine the network relationships and contribution dynamics of users who perform this work and identify behavioral and content dynamics on the biographical articles about the deceased. The collaborations that emerge from posthumous editing of these biographies are sites of significant activity that coalesce into complex but temporary collaborations. Based on these findings, we argue that Wikipedia has re-imagined the obituary into a genre for creating memory spaces in which the death of a subject prompts a form of &quot;death work&quot; involving the collective re-evaluation of article content and a transition into a new mode of data stewardship.;,citation_author=Brian C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Queer Identities, Normative Databases: Challenges to Capturing Queerness On Wikidata;,citation_abstract=The collection, organization, and retrieval of data about queer individuals and their identities challenge the creators and curators of highly structured database systems. While prior research in archival studies and demographics has examined processes of collecting and storing queer identities, they do not examine the complexities of highly democratized platforms that lack top-down mandates that often structure archival schemas. To examine the representation of queer people on open-platform databases, we performed a trace ethnography and thematic analysis of Wikidata, an open collaboration, highly structured database. We specifically examined the creation of, changes to, discussions around, and impacts of properties that encode queer identities, such assexual orientation andsex or gender. We found that changes often have unexpected impacts, that contributors struggled to determine vocabulary for queer identities which were accurate across the diverse cultural contexts of the Wikidata community, that the recording of queer identities could cause a stigmatizing effect for LGBTQ+ individuals, with further concerns of spreading rumors or outing closeted people, and that contributors proposing changes which would cause biased representations of queer people. Our analysis demonstrates inherent and unaddressed frictions when translating queer identities to the confines of a structured database. We conclude by discussing ways that the highly bottom-up, collaborative nature of platforms such as Wikidata, often seen as a major strength, can be vulnerable to individuals or small groups derailing and filibustering changes they disagree with on politically charged topics such as queer identities.;,citation_author=Katy Weathington;,citation_author=Jed R.

In a mediated environment obsessed with real-time?of near instantaneous content production and delivery?the question of what constitutes right-time has curiously been overlooked. In this article, I argue that the notion of right-time presented in the above mission statement is reflective not just of Facebook?s algorithmic workings but also of a new temporal regime produced by an increasingly algorithmic media landscape. The article draws on social theory, media studies, and rhetoric, as well as a variety of empirical materials such as patent documents, media industry documents and public discourse to argue for the existence of an ?Eigenzeit? of algorithmic media that hinges on the classic Greek notion of ?kairos,? understood as an opportune time, timeliness, or indeed, ?right-time.?;,citation_author=Taina Bucher;,citation_publication_date=2020-09;,citation_cover_date=2020-09;,citation_year=2020;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444820913560;,citation_issue=9;,citation_doi=10.1177/1461444820913560;,citation_issn=1461-4448;,citation_volume=22;,citation_journal_title=New Media &amp;amp;amp; Society;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Business network becoming: Figurations of time, change and process;,citation_abstract=Concepts such as “time” and “change” are always presaged by metaphor, narratives and other “tropes” and are therefore, representations invented by association, analogy, indirect inferences and figuration. If these representations change, then their meaning also changes. In this paper, we argue that dominant figurations of time have been predominantly mechanistic and a consequence of “substance” metaphysics. The mechanistic metaphor of time constructs comprehensions of time that are linear, homogenous and clock-like. As with any analogical representations, this type of figuration favors some aspects of time and diminishes others. Our proposition is that if we apply an alternative “process metaphysics” to time, then this is associated with different figurative representations. In this paper, we make specific reference to the IMP research tradition where we explore “holographic or rhizomic time” as a different temporal metaphor. We illustrate what linear clock time reveals and hides in a “centered” epistemology and explore what an adoption of “holographic” time would allow us to see, and discuss some of the benefits and limitations of this different figuration of time, which promotes a “de-centered” epistemology.;,citation_author=Sid Lowe;,citation_author=Michel Rod;,citation_publication_date=2018-01;,citation_cover_date=2018-01;,citation_year=2018;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019850117307915;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.indmarman.2017.10.012;,citation_issn=0019-8501;,citation_volume=68;,citation_journal_title=Industrial Marketing Management;">

<h1>Introduction: Wikipedia and The Technicity of Time</h1>
<p>Time is a supple medium. It winds itself into many shapes. It surges through the heartwood. It lies upon the bark. It carves rock and unfolds in song. It creates myriad structures, then entropically destroys them. It races, dallies, recurs, reverses, accelerates, splits and stops.</p>
<p>Despite its suppleness, time has definite characteristics. It forms rhythms. It weaves people and plants and animals into lives and seasons. It founds eras.</p>
<p>What are the characteristics of time in the digital era? The question has been a major preoccupation for humanists and social scientists in the twenty-first century. Theorists in many disciplines have argued that ‘presentism’ is the dominant ‘temporal regime’ of the twenty-first century <span class="citation" data-cites="assmann_is_2020 hartog_regimes_2017">(<a href="#ref-assmann_is_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Assmann 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-hartog_regimes_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Hartog 2017</a>)</span>. We inhabit a ‘broad present’ <span class="citation" data-cites="gumbrecht_our_2014">(<a href="#ref-gumbrecht_our_2014" role="doc-biblioref">Gumbrecht 2014</a>)</span> or a ‘timeless time’ <span class="citation" data-cites="castells_rise_2010">(<a href="#ref-castells_rise_2010" role="doc-biblioref">Castells 2010</a>)</span> in which big data and frictionless communication have conspired with the cult of memory to abolish the future and bring the past into the present. We live in a rubble-world of accumulating fact. Other theorists have diagnosed the problem as ‘temporal acceleration’. We experience time as running ever faster, argues <span class="citation" data-cites="wajcman_pressed_2015">Wajcman (<a href="#ref-wajcman_pressed_2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015, 77</a>)</span>, because it has become ‘deroutinized’. We are trapped in the present because we are present in so many places at once: on the phone to daycare while picking up dinner ingredients in the supermarket on our lunchbreak at work. Digital media are the handmaidens of post-industrial capitalism. Without them, we would be unable to maintain the modicum of order we currently enjoy.</p>
<p>A weakness of many theories of temporality is their focus on the <em>products</em> rather than the <em>production</em> of temporal regimes. To characterise a temporal regime, the theorist considers some cultural products, such as literary texts <span class="citation" data-cites="gumbrecht_our_2014 hartog_regimes_2017">(<a href="#ref-gumbrecht_our_2014" role="doc-biblioref">Gumbrecht 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-hartog_regimes_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Hartog 2017</a>)</span> or work-time statistics <span class="citation" data-cites="castells_rise_2010">(<a href="#ref-castells_rise_2010" role="doc-biblioref">Castells 2010</a>)</span> and tries to determine what kind of temporal regime those products represent. Such accounts necessarily raise the question: how is it possible to erect a temporal regime in the first place? A compelling answer is given by <span class="citation" data-cites="orlikowski_its_2002">Orlikowski and Yates (<a href="#ref-orlikowski_its_2002" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a>)</span>, who argue that the temporal regime of an organisation is produced by the ‘practices’ of its members. Such practices can modify a temporal regime ‘implicitly’ or ‘explicitly’ <span class="citation" data-cites="orlikowski_its_2002">(<a href="#ref-orlikowski_its_2002" role="doc-biblioref">2002, 687</a>)</span>, though in either case the key force of change is <em>repetition</em>, or ‘recurrent action’ <span class="citation" data-cites="orlikowski_its_2002">(<a href="#ref-orlikowski_its_2002" role="doc-biblioref">2002, 696</a>)</span>. Temporal regimes are rhythmical. They are produced by the recurrent actions of people, who learn to act in concert as the members of an orchestra.</p>
<p>In this paper, we build on Orlikowski and Yates’s theory of temporal structuration to describe the temporal regime of Wikipedia. We show that to explain Wikipedia’s temporal regime, it is necessary to supplement Orlikowski and Yates’s theory of <em>repetition</em> with a theory of time’s <em>representation</em> and its <em>technicity</em>. Only by accounting for these three aspects of time can we adequately answer our central questions: (1) what is Wikipedia time? and (2) what can it tell us about digital time more broadly?</p>
<p>Our central case study is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Yapperbot">Yapperbot/uncurrenter</a>, a ‘bot’ or computer program that polices the barrier between past and present on English Wikipedia. We situate Yapperbot/uncurrenter in Wikipedia’s broader sociotechnical systems. We examine how it interacts with human editors. We show how it fits into Wikipedia’s complex array of interfaces and data streams. We present Yapperbot/uncurrenter as a prime example of the ‘technicity of time’. It is a technology that attempts to make time concrete, to freeze it into an object. Yapperbot/uncurrenter is like the master’s clock in an eighteenth-century factory. It ticks regularly (<em>repetition</em>), shows the time (<em>representation</em>) and acts impersonally (<em>technicity</em>).</p>
<p>Yapperbot/uncurrenter performs a single, simple task. Each hour, it scans English Wikipedia, finding every article that ‘transcludes’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Current">Template:Current</a>. If the article has not been edited in over five hours, it deletes the template.</p>
<p>A ‘template’ is a microprogram that peforms a common task. In the case of Template:Current, the editor inserts the code <code>{current}</code> into an article. This adds a warning banner to the article (Figure <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:banner_collage}\)</span>), and automatically adds the article to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Current_events">Category:Current_events</a>. When Yapperbot/uncurrenter deletes the template, the banner disappears, as does the article’s categorisation as a ‘current event’. This would seem to consign the article to the past. But here lies the first twist in the tale. When Yapperbot/uncurrenter deletes Template:Current, it leaves an oddly contradictory message in the article’s edit history:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Auto-removing {{current}} - no edits in 5hrs+. The event may still be current, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Current">the {{current}} template is designed only for articles which many editors are editing, and is usually up for less than a day</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On English Wikipedia, an event can be ‘current’ without being <code>{current}</code>. This contradiction lies at the heart of Wikipedia’s temporal regime. When Wikipedia’s English editors debated the need for Yapperbot/uncurrenter, they ran straight into the contradiction between two different understandings of time. To stabilise Wikipedia’s temporal regime, they had to resolve this contradiction. As we show below, Wikipedia’s English editors made the radical move to try and abolish the present, a path that editors of other-language Wikipedias have refused to take.</p>

<p>Wikipedia is one of the few places where where the construction of a temporal regime can be (almost) directly observed. Unlike other prominent social media platforms, Wikipedia is an ‘open’ project, every one of whose facets can be publicly altered and debated. The encyclopaedia can only be changed in public. Nearly every step in the construction of the temporal regime leaves an easily-recovered mark. It may appear that an ‘open’ platform such as Wikipedia could never tolerate something as closed as a temporal <em>regime</em>, but as <span class="citation" data-cites="tkacz_wikipedia_2015">Tkacz (<a href="#ref-tkacz_wikipedia_2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> shows, Wikipedia’s openness has not prevented it from developing a restrictive ‘frame’ of rules and concepts that govern its activities. Quite the contrary. Wikipedia is not only the most open of social networks—it is surely also the most highly organised.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is also a place where ‘technicities of time’ are especially prominent. Large parts of the encyclopedia are managed by bots such as Yapperbot/uncurrenter, which are powerful actors in Wikipedia’s sociotechnical system <span class="citation" data-cites="niederer_wisdom_2010 dijck_culture_2013 geiger_work_2010 geiger_when_2013 tkacz_wikipedia_2015 geiger_operationalizing_2017 halfaker_bots_2012 livingstone_population_2016">(<a href="#ref-niederer_wisdom_2010" role="doc-biblioref">Niederer and Dijck 2010</a>; <a href="#ref-dijck_culture_2013" role="doc-biblioref">Dijck 2013, 137–40</a>; <a href="#ref-geiger_work_2010" role="doc-biblioref">R.

Bots are best understand as users of the platform, rather than as extensions of their human developers. Indeed, Wikipedia bots have ordinary user accounts like human Wikipedians, although they also have special privileges and their actions are tracked separately by the system. Bots incarnate or enact Wikipedia’s culture, as Stuart Geiger has revealed in a pathbreaking series of papers <span class="citation" data-cites="geiger_social_2009 geiger_lives_2011 geiger_are_2013 geiger_beyond_2017 kennedy_textual_2010">(<a href="#ref-geiger_social_2009" role="doc-biblioref">R.

Stuart Geiger 2017</a>; see also <a href="#ref-kennedy_textual_2010" role="doc-biblioref">Kennedy 2010</a>)</span>. To understand bots, he explains, it is not sufficient to read the source code, although there may well be important policies, procedures or ideals ‘encoded’ in the source <span class="citation" data-cites="geiger_beyond_2017">(<a href="#ref-geiger_beyond_2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017, 9</a>)</span>. Instead, it is essential to observe how bots act in the wild, and to observe how human users and other bots interact with <em>them</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="geiger_lives_2011 geiger_beyond_2017">(<a href="#ref-geiger_lives_2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>; <a href="#ref-geiger_beyond_2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>. In this spirit, we pursue Yapperbot/uncurrenter through Wikipedia, to see how it works and whom it fights to uphold Wikipedia’s temporal regime.</p>
<p>Our discussion falls into four main sections. In <a href="#how-to-make-time">How to make time</a>, we present a theory of ‘temporal mapping’ to show how temporal regimes can be produced through repetition, representation and technicity. In <a href="#wikipedia-time-1-the-primacy-of-the-past">Wikipedia time (1): the primacy of the past</a>, we consider existing research into Wikipedia’s temporal regime, and consider the various ways that time enters into the encyclopaedia. In <a href="#the-birth-of-the-bot-that-makes-history">The birth of the bot that makes history</a>, we describe the series of events that led to Yapperbot/uncurrenter’s creation, and use a range of qualitative and quantitiative methods to analyse its contributions to Wikipedia. Finally, in <a href="#wikipedia-time-2-encyclopaedia-time">Wikipedia time (2): encyclopaedia time</a>, we offer our conclusions about Wikipedia’s temporal regime, contextualising Wikipedia as one in a long line of encyclopaedic projects that attempt to encompass time. We conclude that Wikipedia’s temporal regime is <em>complex regime of historicity</em>. It is <em>complex</em> because it is a clash of many temporalities, which are contested by the people and other actors on the platform. It is <em>historicist</em> because it attempts to situate its human participants in the process of history through literary representation. The example of Wikipedia’s <em>complex historicity</em> supports the idea that time remains contingent. There is no fixed regime of digital time or network time. Time is out there for the making.</p>

<section id="how-to-make-time" class="level1">
<h1>How to make time</h1>
<p>We make temporal regimes by mixing time and space. We map time. The crying of the infant, the waxing of the moon, the rising of the dough, the coming of the moths, the shadow of the sundial, the alignment of the text, the stellar orientation of the standing stones—all are maps, which crystallise time in space. Whether this mapping occurs by analysis or synthesis depends on your view of time. For Henri Bergson, the ‘spatialization’ of time is analytic. Time is fundamentally <em>duration</em> [<em>durée</em>]. Our basic experience of time is continuous. When we spatialize time, we divide it, for instance when split it into hours and minutes, and map these divisions onto the clock <span class="citation" data-cites="bergson_oeuvres_1984">(<a href="#ref-bergson_oeuvres_1984" role="doc-biblioref">1984, 71–72</a>)</span>. For Arthur Schopenhauer, by contrast, the spatialization of time is synthetic. Our basic experience of time is discontinuous. Time is an endless series of unique moments: ‘Succession is the whole being of time’ <span class="citation" data-cites="schopenhauer_werke_1999">(<a href="#ref-schopenhauer_werke_1999" role="doc-biblioref">Schopenhauer 1999, vol. 1</a>, p.&nbsp;37)</span>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> We can only form a conception of the ‘duration’ [<em>Dauer</em>] of things when time and space are united in the ‘understanding’ [<em>Verstand</em>] <span class="citation" data-cites="schopenhauer_werke_1999">(<a href="#ref-schopenhauer_werke_1999" role="doc-biblioref">1999, vol. 1</a>, p.&nbsp;40)</span>. Had Schopenhauer experienced the cinema, he might have chosen it as his metaphor. From the whirring filmstrip of individual moments, we project the movie of life. Bergson rejected the cinema as a metaphor for consciousness <span class="citation" data-cites="bergson_oeuvres_1984">(<a href="#ref-bergson_oeuvres_1984" role="doc-biblioref">1984, 752ff</a>)</span>. For him, the Kantian view of time as succession insufficiently distinguishes time from space. To think time as succession, we need to use a spatial metaphor such as a ‘line’ or ‘chain’, and ‘juxtapose’ time’s moments along it <span class="citation" data-cites="bergson_oeuvres_1984">(<a href="#ref-bergson_oeuvres_1984" role="doc-biblioref">1984, 68</a>)</span>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> A Kantian like Schopenhauer might reply that Bergson is too empirical. What makes it possible for Bergson to experience time as a non-spatial duration, if not the synthetic activity of the understanding?</p>
<p>Whichever theory of spatialization we adopt, it is clear that there are many ways to map time. The time of the wheat is not the time of the Twitter feed. The sheer variety of temporal mappings is a key theme in the work of Mikhail Bakhtin. In his classic study of the ‘chronotope’, Bakhtin argues that different forms of literature are defined by their different forms of time <span class="citation" data-cites="bakhtin_dialogic_1981">(<a href="#ref-bakhtin_dialogic_1981" role="doc-biblioref">1981, 85</a>)</span>. Greek romance is charactersised by ‘adventure-time’ <span class="citation" data-cites="bakhtin_dialogic_1981">(<a href="#ref-bakhtin_dialogic_1981" role="doc-biblioref">1981, 87</a>)</span>, modern fiction by ‘historical time’ <span class="citation" data-cites="bakhtin_dialogic_1981">(<a href="#ref-bakhtin_dialogic_1981" role="doc-biblioref">1981, 165</a>)</span>, Dostoyevsky’s existential novels by ‘mystery- and carnvial-time’ <span class="citation" data-cites="bakhtin_dialogic_1981">(<a href="#ref-bakhtin_dialogic_1981" role="doc-biblioref">1981, 249</a>)</span>. The time-mapping technology in this case is writing. Writers shape time with words. Words can shape time literally, for instance when Greek romanciers stitch together the moments of adventure-time using ‘link-words’ such as ‘suddenly’ or ‘at that moment’ <span class="citation" data-cites="bakhtin_dialogic_1981">(<a href="#ref-bakhtin_dialogic_1981" role="doc-biblioref">1981, 92</a>)</span>. Words can shape time symbolically, for instance when a writer portrays the ‘path of life’ as a road <span class="citation" data-cites="bakhtin_dialogic_1981">(<a href="#ref-bakhtin_dialogic_1981" role="doc-biblioref">1981, 120</a>)</span>. Bakhtin demonstrates how a technology such as writing can constitute different forms of time; indeed, his researches support the more radical argument of Bernard Stiegler, who claims that ‘organized inorganic beings’ such as novels might be generally ‘<em>constitutive</em> … of temporality as well as spatiality’ <span class="citation" data-cites="stiegler_technics_1998">(<a href="#ref-stiegler_technics_1998" role="doc-biblioref">1998, 17</a>)</span>. We experience time and space through the maps we make of them.</p>
<p>Maps structure time by structuring attention. The Sunderland petitioners in 1800: ‘many people are obliged to be up at all hours of the night to attend the tides’ <span class="citation" data-cites="thompson_time_1967">(quoted in <a href="#ref-thompson_time_1967" role="doc-biblioref">Thompson 1967, 60</a>)</span>. To <em>attend</em>. The tides rise and fall (<em>repetition</em>). Through their height, they tell the the hour, day, month and season (<em>representation</em>). They are known partly by sight, and partly by moon-phase and tide-chart and plumb-line (<em>technicity</em>). To attend upon the tides is to know not only <em>what</em> time it is (high tide, spring), but <em>what kind</em> of time it is (to depart or return). In this way, attention plays a ‘constructive role … in fabricating tools and technical ensembles’ <span class="citation" data-cites="hayles_how_2012">(<a href="#ref-hayles_how_2012" role="doc-biblioref">Hayles 2012, 91</a>)</span>. The boat, the compass, the fishing-line and the fisher are fused together by attention on the tides.</p>
<p>Through the power of attention, temporal <em>maps</em> can uphold temporal <em>regimes</em>. The classic example comes from the Industrial Revolution. <span class="citation" data-cites="thompson_time_1967">Thompson (<a href="#ref-thompson_time_1967" role="doc-biblioref">1967</a>)</span> memorably describes the scene. As the ‘need for the synchronization of labour’ grew, so did the need for ‘[a]ttention to time’ <span class="citation" data-cites="thompson_time_1967">(<a href="#ref-thompson_time_1967" role="doc-biblioref">Thompson 1967, 70</a>)</span>—or rather, the need for a particular kind of attention, which Thompson calls ‘time-discipline’. Masters used the factory clock (a map) to impose time-discipline on their workers (a regime). They fiddled with the clock to extract more hours of labour. They handed out gold watches for long service. Workers themselves would blow a windfall on a watch of their own—for the status, or the power? This example demonstrates why the repetition-theory of <span class="citation" data-cites="orlikowski_its_2002">Orlikowski and Yates (<a href="#ref-orlikowski_its_2002" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a>)</span> must be supplemented by the concepts of representation and technicity. The ‘recurrent action’ of factory workers can only be fully explained if we include the clock, which represented time as a succession of hours and minutes to be spent working, and which legitimated the new temporal regime by its (apparent) impersonality.</p>
<p>Not all temporal maps are as strict or authoritative as Thompson’s factory-clock. Theorists of <em>technicity</em> observe that technical objects vary greatly in their degree of ‘concretization’ <span class="citation" data-cites="stiegler_technics_1998">(<a href="#ref-stiegler_technics_1998" role="doc-biblioref">Stiegler 1998</a>)</span>. Concretization is a process of unification. As a technology becomes more concrete, its parts become ‘organs’ that ‘function more and more as parts of a whole’ <span class="citation" data-cites="stiegler_technics_1998">(<a href="#ref-stiegler_technics_1998" role="doc-biblioref">Stiegler 1998, 71</a>)</span>. It thus becomes autonomous. It ceases to be a ‘utensil’ of a human ‘actor’; it becomes itself an ‘actor’ with human ‘operators’ <span class="citation" data-cites="stiegler_technics_1998">(<a href="#ref-stiegler_technics_1998" role="doc-biblioref">Stiegler 1998, 66</a>)</span>. The drying of hops was once regulated by the dryer, who touched and smelt the cones to determine the drying-time. The dryer relied on comparatively abstract technology (the oast-house and its cowl) to regulate the time by regulating the temperature and humidity. Today, the dryer is a machine, which determines the drying-time autonomously using clocks and sensors. Such a concrete technology in effect concretizes time itself. The drying-time is nothing but the time it takes for the machine to work.</p>
<p>In the same way we characterise technicities as <em>concrete</em> or <em>abstract</em>, we can characterise repetitions as <em>regular</em> or <em>irregular</em>, and representations as <em>clear</em> or <em>vague</em>. <span class="citation" data-cites="thompson_time_1967">Thompson (<a href="#ref-thompson_time_1967" role="doc-biblioref">1967</a>)</span> repeatedly stresses the ‘regularity’ of capitalist work-patterns, as opposed to the ‘irregularity’ of work in pre-capitalist temporal regimes. While we may reject Thompson’s schematism, we must accept his observation that repetition can vary in its lawfulness and predictability. The tanpura drones regularly while the sitar wanders in endless novelty. In much the same way, a representation of time can be clear and bright or vague and suggestive. A modern composer gives the tempo in beats per minute, where a Romantic requests the orchestra to play <em>Bewegt, doch nicht schnell</em>.</p>
<p>Temporal regimes are seldom unitary. They combine many temporal maps to create a ‘multiplicity’ <span class="citation" data-cites="orlikowski_its_2002">(<a href="#ref-orlikowski_its_2002" role="doc-biblioref">Orlikowski and Yates 2002, 687</a>)</span> or ‘complex’ of temporalities <span class="citation" data-cites="hayles_how_2012">(<a href="#ref-hayles_how_2012" role="doc-biblioref">Hayles 2012, 89</a>)</span>. This complexity is especially apparent on the plane of representation. Digital media can present many different interfaces to time. A Wikipedia article represents time as a connected narrative on the ‘Article’ tab, as a list of versions on the ‘View history’ tab, as an ongoing debate between editors on the ‘Talk’ tab, as a time-series of web hits on the Pageviews tool, as a pie-chart of contributions on the XTools interface, as an immutable series of transactions in the underlying MYSQL database, and so on. Such interfaces form a single unstable ‘complex’ because they are folded together by Wikipedia’s various actors. This complexity leads to contradiction, which leads to contention, which led, in one case, to Yapperbot/uncurrenter.</p>
<p>In sum, we define a temporal regime as a system of temporal maps that structure a particular form of life through the modulation of human attention. We can now refine our research questions. How do Wikipedians map time? Which mappings are established, which are contested, and how does Yapperbot/uncurrenter fit among them? How has digital technology changed the nature of temporal mapping?</p>

<section id="wikipedia-time-1-the-primacy-of-the-past" class="level1">
<h1>Wikipedia time (1): the primacy of the past</h1>
<p><em>TODO: Rewrite/adapt</em></p>
<p>How does Wikipedia portray the past? Scholars typically give three answers. Some argue that Wikipedia produces <em>history</em>: it represents the past in literary form. Wikipedia history may be more “colorful,” “anecdotal” and “factualist” than “professional history,” observes Roy Rosenzweig, but history it most certainly is <span class="citation" data-cites="rosenzweig_can_2006">(<a href="#ref-rosenzweig_can_2006" role="doc-biblioref">Rosenzweig 2006, 142</a>)</span>. Others argue that Wikipedia articles comprise <em>collective memories</em> that evoke shared experiences. From this perspective, Wikipedia’s Talk pages are more important than the articles themselves, and its editors are more important than its readers. As Christian Pentzold argues, Wikipedia’s Talk pages are non-physical “memory places,” where editors meet to “negotiat[e]” the “memorable elements” of their experiences <span class="citation" data-cites="pentzold_fixing_2009">(<a href="#ref-pentzold_fixing_2009" role="doc-biblioref">Pentzold 2009, 264</a>)</span>. Numerous scholars have followed in Pentzold’s wake to examine how editors “build” or “form” collective memories in Wikipedia <span class="citation" data-cites="ferron_collective_2011 ferron_arab_2011 porter_visual_2020">(<a href="#ref-ferron_collective_2011" role="doc-biblioref">Ferron and Massa 2011b</a>, <a href="#ref-ferron_arab_2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011a</a>; <a href="#ref-porter_visual_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Porter, Krafft, and Keegan 2020</a>)</span>. A third group of scholars argue that Wikipedia is a repository of <em>facts</em>. Wikipedia may well publish works of history and store collective memories, but its main role is to produce atomistic facts that are propagated through knowledge graphs <span class="citation" data-cites="ford_rise_2020 ford_writing_2022">(<a href="#ref-ford_rise_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Ford 2020</a>, <a href="#ref-ford_writing_2022" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>. Wikipedia may be <em>memory</em> to thousands of editors. It may be <em>history</em> to millions of readers. But it is mere <em>fact</em> to billions of search requests and API calls.</p>
<p>These approaches are not mutually exclusive. Search engines, readers and editors all produce and consume Wikipedia in different ways, and a complete account of the encyclopedia must include them all. In which case, we must ask: how are the historical, memorial and factual aspects of Wikipedia related?</p>
<p>One way to approach this question is to focus precisely on the <em>pastness</em> of history, memory and fact. Pastness is central to Wikipedia’s self-definition. “Wikipedia is not a crystal ball,” reads <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT">a famous policy</a>, wherein we also read that Wikipedia is “not a newspaper.” It is the pastness of Wikipedia that allows it to function simultaneously as history, memory and fact. Pastness is obviously a feature of both history and memory: I cannot remember an event nor write its history until it has happened. The pastness of <em>fact</em> is less obvious. Wikipedia contains facts about fictional spacecraft, embroidery techniques and the heat death of the universe. In what sense can such facts be said to be “past”?</p>
<p>Wikipedia itself provides an answer in two of its foundational policies. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research">‘No Original Research’</a>, no new facts are to be admitted to the encyclopaedia. The only allowable facts are—the <em>old</em>. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view">‘Neutral Point of View’</a>, no controversial facts are to be admitted to the encyclopaedia. The only allowable facts are—the <em>settled</em>. Facts are geological. Only time can grind down the seashells of evidence and bring forth the limestone of objectivity. Editors who wish to include new or unsettled facts in the encyclopaedia are advised that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:There_is_no_deadline">‘There is no deadline’</a>. <em>Þæs oferēode; þisses swa mæg.</em> That passed; so may this. Eventually everything is past.</p>
<p>Despite its supposed pastness, Wikipedia is well-known as a source of information on current events. It is ‘An Encylopedia with Breaking News’ <span class="citation" data-cites="keegan_encyclopedia_2019">(<a href="#ref-keegan_encyclopedia_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Keegan 2019</a>)</span>. Current events dominate Wikipedia, accounting for the lion’s share of user contributions and page views at any given time <span class="citation" data-cites="keegan_hot_2011">(<a href="#ref-keegan_hot_2011" role="doc-biblioref">Keegan, Gergle, and Contractor 2011</a>)</span>. Scholars have analysed Wikipedia’s coverage of current events in detail. We now know how Wikipedia’s editors clash over the nature and definition of current events <span class="citation" data-cites="ford_writing_2022 pentzold_fixing_2009">(<a href="#ref-ford_writing_2022" role="doc-biblioref">Ford 2022</a>; <a href="#ref-pentzold_fixing_2009" role="doc-biblioref">Pentzold 2009</a>)</span>, how they link current events into larger thematic structures <span class="citation" data-cites="twyman_black_2017">(<a href="#ref-twyman_black_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Twyman, Keegan, and Shaw 2017</a>)</span>, how they adopt newsroom practices to co-ordinate their efforts <span class="citation" data-cites="avieson_breaking_2019">(<a href="#ref-avieson_breaking_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Avieson 2019</a>)</span>, how they revisit old articles to commemorate traumatic events <span class="citation" data-cites="ferron_beyond_2014">(<a href="#ref-ferron_beyond_2014" role="doc-biblioref">Ferron and Massa 2014</a>)</span>, and how they shape the interpretation of events using images <span class="citation" data-cites="porter_visual_2020">(<a href="#ref-porter_visual_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Porter, Krafft, and Keegan 2020</a>)</span>. One thing we <em>don’t</em> know is how Wikipedia’s editors decide what is ‘current’. How does Wikipedia distinguish the past from the present at the very threshold of time? How does it resolve the contradiction between the pastness of the encyclopaedia and the presentness of the current?</p>
<p>Most readers of Wikipedia will have seen what editors do when an article trespasses on the present: mark it with one of the available <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Current_event_templates">Current Event Templates</a>. The main template is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Current">Template:Current</a>, which at the time of writing is available on 116 language editions of Wikipedia. When the template is added to an article, a familiar banner appears at the top of the page (Figure <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:banner_collage}\)</span>), and the article is automatically added to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Current_events">Category:Current Events</a> or a related category. Each language edition has its own distinct version of Template:Current, and may also sport a range of related Templates. French Wikipedia, for instance, distinguishes ‘Événements en cours’ [ongoing events] from ‘Événements récents’ [recent events] in its <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mod%C3%A8le:%C3%89v%C3%A9nement_en_cours">main template</a>, and provides several related templates such as <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mod%C3%A8le:Bataille_en_cours">Modèle:Bataille en cours</a> [Template:Ongoing battle] and <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mod%C3%A8le:Mort_r%C3%A9cente">Modèle:Mort récente</a> [Template:Recent death]. German Wikipedia, by contrast, has only a single <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorlage:Laufendes_Ereignis">Current Events template</a>, but it is customisable, so that editors can replace the phrase “aktuelles Ereignis” [current event] in the banner with a more specific description such as “die derzeitige Sportveranstaltung” [the ongoing sporting event].</p>
<p>New twist in the tale: a user ‘killed’ Yapperbot/uncurrent on 24/4/2023 because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=1151461527&amp;oldid=986550108&amp;title=User%3AYapperbot%2Fkill%2FUncurrenter">they complained it had removed {{current}} from a current event</a>.</p>
<p>On the surface, Template:Current might seem like a simple phenomenon. Editors mark an article when it is “current,” then remove the template when its currency is ended. <span class="citation" data-cites="avieson_breaking_2019">Avieson (<a href="#ref-avieson_breaking_2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> likens Template:Current to the “live” icon on a newspaper blog or television news. While Template:Current is present, the article functions as live coverage; when the template is removed, the article gradually becomes encyclopaedic.</p>
<p>But the use of Template:Current is not simple, and has vexed Wikipedia’s editors for years. <span class="citation" data-cites="avieson_breaking_2019">Avieson (<a href="#ref-avieson_breaking_2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> herself grapples with the problem. Although she argues for a distinction between “news” and “encyclopaedias,” she also observes that Wikipedia’s coverage of current events “blurs the boundaries of both news and temporality.” These blurred boundaries are a problem for Wikipedia’s editors, and editors in different langauges have clarified the distinction between past, present and future in different ways. In this context, English Wikipedia is extremist. Unlike other language editions, English Wikipedia strictly polices the use of Template:Current with a bot: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Yapperbot">Yapperbot/uncurrenter</a>. Yapperbot/uncurrenter scans English Wikipedia hourly, examining every article that includes Template:Current and deleting the template if the article has not been edited in the last five hours. English Wikipedia is also one of the few larger language editions without a <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Future">Template:Future</a> to mark events that have yet to occur. English Wikipedia deleted Template:Future in 2009 after an official process, and several attempts to resurrect the template have foundered. Meanwhile French, Italian, Bengali, Chinese and 51 other-language Wikipedias maintain a Template:Future.</p>
<p>Why does practice vary across the different language editions? What led to the extremely strict approach of English Wikipedia, in which Template:Current is ruthlessly policed by an artificial agent, and the future is not explicitly marked? What can this tell us about Wikipedia’s “temporal regime” <span class="citation" data-cites="assmann_is_2020">(<a href="#ref-assmann_is_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Assmann 2020</a>)</span>?</p>
<p>We try to answer these questions by focussing on Yapperbot/uncurrenter. We describe the history of Template:Current and recount the debates that led to the bot’s creation. We then examine Yapperbot/uncurrenter’s contributions to English Wikipedia, comparing its practice with the practice of human editors on English Wikipedia and other-language Wikipedias.</p>
