	abstract = {The online encyclopedia Wikipedia is both a cultural reference to store, refer to, and organize digitized and digital information, as well as a key contemporary digital heritage endeavor in itself. Capitalizing on this dual nature of the project, this article introduces Wikipedia as a digital gateway to and site of an active engagement with cultural heritage. We have developed the open source and freely available analysis architecture Contropedia to examine already existing volunteer user-generated participation around cultural heritage and to promote further engagement with it. Conceptually, we employ the notion of memory work, as it helps to treat Wikipedia's articles, edit histories, and discussion pages as a rich resource to study how cultural heritage is received and (re)worked in and across languages and cultures. Contropedia's architecture allows for the study of the negotiations around and appreciation of cultural heritage without assuming an unchallenged and universal understanding of cultural heritage. The analysis facilitated by Contropedia thus sheds light on the contentious articulation of perspectives on tangible and intangible heritage grounded by conflicting conceptions of events, ideas, places, or persons. Technologically, Contropedia combines techniques based on mining article edit histories and analyzing discussion patterns in talk pages to identify and visualize heritage-related disputes within an article, and to compare these across language versions. In terms of digital heritage, Contropedia presents a powerful tool that opens up a core resource to cultural heritage studies. Moreover, it can form part of a conceptually grounded, technically advanced, and practically enrolled infrastructure for public education that opens up the dynamic formation of both knowledge about cultural heritage and new forms of digital cultural heritage that show a considerable amount of friction.},

	abstract = {A majority of current work in events extraction assumes the static nature of relationships in constant expertise knowledge bases. However, in collaborative environments, such as Wikipedia, information and systems are extraordinarily dynamic over time. In this work, we introduce a new approach for extracting complex structures of events from Wikipedia. We advocate a new model to represent events by engaging more than one entities that are generalizable to an arbitrary language. The evolution of an event is captured successfully primarily based on analyzing the user edits records in Wikipedia. Our work presents a basis for a singular class of evolution-aware entity-primarily based enrichment algorithms and will extensively increase the quality of entity accessibility and temporal retrieval for Wikipedia. We formalize this problem case and conduct comprehensive experiments on a real dataset of 1.8 million Wikipedia articles in order to show the effectiveness of our proposed answer. Furthermore, we suggest a new event validation automatic method relying on a supervised model to predict the presence of events in a non-annotated corpus. As the extra document source for event validation, we chose the Web due to its ease of accessibility and wide event coverage. Our outcomes display that we are capable of acquiring 70\% precision evaluated on a manually annotated corpus. Ultimately, we conduct a comparison of our strategy versus the Current Event Portal of Wikipedia and discover that our proposed WikipEvent along with the usage of Co-References technique may be utilized to provide new and more data on events.},

	abstract = {How Wikipedia collaboration addresses the challenges of openness, consensus, and leadership in a historical pursuit for a universal encyclopedia. Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, is built by a community—a community of Wikipedians who are expected to “assume good faith” when interacting with one another. In Good Faith Collaboration, Joseph Reagle examines this unique collaborative culture. Wikipedia, says Reagle, is not the first effort to create a freely shared, universal encyclopedia; its early twentieth-century ancestors include Paul Otlet's Universal Repository and H. G. Wells's proposal for a World Brain. Both these projects, like Wikipedia, were fuelled by new technology—which at the time included index cards and microfilm. What distinguishes Wikipedia from these and other more recent ventures is Wikipedia's good-faith collaborative culture, as seen not only in the writing and editing of articles but also in their discussion pages and edit histories. Keeping an open perspective on both knowledge claims and other contributors, Reagle argues, creates an extraordinary collaborative potential. Wikipedia's style of collaborative production has been imitated, analyzed, and satirized. Despite the social unease over its implications for individual autonomy, institutional authority, and the character (and quality) of cultural products, Wikipedia's good-faith collaborative culture has brought us closer than ever to a realization of the century-old pursuit of a universal encyclopedia.},

It first gives an overview of the recent handbooks and anthologies of memory studies, which testify to the institutionalisation of the young discipline. Then, it discusses the emergence of cultural memory studies, one of the most fruitful and promising trends in the memory studies of the last decade. And finally, it addresses the old debate over the relationship of history and memory, in order to propose an alternative conceptual framework for it and demonstrate the perspectives opened by a new avenue of research, mnemohistory. To conclude with, it argues that the rise of memory studies can be regarded as part of a broader change in how we nowadays see time and the interrelations of the past, the present and the future. It is plausible that these developments have irreversibly changed both the nature and outlooks of history writing.},

“According to Sontag, a society is able to choose, to th in k and to speak, but not to rem em ber. It can choose w ithout a will, it can think w ithout the capacity of reason, it can speak w ithout a tongue, b u t it cannot rem em ber w ith o u t a m em oiy.” (Assmann, 2008, p. 50) Assman summarises Sontag's opposition to 'collective memory'“Sem antic m em ory is related to th e learning and storing capacity of th e m ind. It is acquired by collective instruction and the site of continuous learning, acquisition, and retention of both general and specialized knowledge th at connects us w ith others and the surrounding world. Episodic memory, on the other hand, enshrines purely personal incidents as individually experienced; though it can be com m unicated and exchanged, it cannot be transferred from one individual to another w ithout changing the quality of the experience through external representation.” (Assmann, 2008, p. 51) In psychological terms, collective memory could be 'semantic' rather than 'episodic'.“M aurice Halbw achs (who is acknow ledged today as one o f th e p atro n s o f m em ory discourse)” (Assmann, 2008, p. 51) key thinker“W hat is called collective m em ory, w rites Sontag, is n o t a rem em ­ bering but a stipulating: groups indeed define them selves by agree­ ing upon w hat they hold to be im portant, to w hich story they accord em inence, w hich anxieties and values they share. According to Sontag, th e te rm collective m em ory is ju s t a n o th er nam e for ideology. The Germ an historian R einhart Koselleck shared this opinion. He distin­ guished betw een two forms of truth: one subjective, one objective.” (Assmann, 2008, p. 52) For Sontag and Kosselleck, 'collective memory' = 'ideology'There is a whiff of 'authenticity' about this whole affair... I think I am decidedly of Assmann's school on this topic.“The use o f th e term ideology is grounded on th e rock o f a self-assured tru th .” (Assmann, 2008, p. 53) 'ideology' has fallen out of favour as a concept, and scholars have ceased to arrogantly assume that their own perspective is 'the truth'“It is in particular th e insight into the irreducible constructedness of both our memories and the work o f the historian th at has taught us to discard th e term ideology as a descriptive term and recognize it as a purely polem ical tool.” (Assmann, 2008, p. 53)“They have lost som e of th eir singular luster, though, as they have to cope w ith th e “m em o ry boom ,” in w hich activists, politicians, citizens, artists, film producers, m edia m agnets, custodians of m use­ ums, and many other experts are engaged in the common enterprise of reconstructing and shaping the past.” (Assmann, 2008, p. 54) Historians are now just a small part of the process of collective memory, due to the 'memory boom'“It is argued th a t feelings are exploited in th e m edia m a rk e t at th e expense o f cognitive functions.” (Assmann, 2008, p. 54)“W hile the term m em oiy has ousted th e term ideology, it has reinforced th e term “id en tity ” on an individual a n d in p articu lar on a collective level.” (Assmann, 2008, p. 54)“To co u n ter th e criticism of skeptics such as Susan Sontag and R einhart Koselleck, it m ust be em phasized th at the step from individ­ 5 4 social researc” (Assmann, 2008, p. 54)“ual to collective m em ory does not afford an easy analogy.” (Assmann, 2008, p. 55) collective memory is not simply individual memory summed or multiplied“there is, of course, no equivalent to the neurological system” (Assmann, 2008, p. 55) It is interesting that Assman denies that collective memory has a 'neurological system' – the most common metaphor for systems like Wikipedia is precisely the 'network'!“The manifestations of political and cultural memory, on the o ther hand, are radically different in th at they are grounded on the m ore durable carriers of external symbols and representations.” (Assmann, 2008, p. 55) Wikipedia probably = 'political and social' memory, in Assman's terms

	abstract = {Wikipedia’s first twenty years: how what began as an experiment in collaboration became the world’s most popular reference work.
We have been looking things up in Wikipedia for twenty years. What began almost by accident—a wiki attached to a nascent online encyclopedia—has become the world’s most popular reference work. Regarded at first as the scholarly equivalent of a Big Mac, Wikipedia is now known for its reliable sourcing and as a bastion of (mostly) reasoned interaction. How has Wikipedia, built on a model of radical collaboration, remained true to its original mission of “free access to the sum of all human knowledge” when other tech phenomena have devolved into advertising platforms? In this book, scholars, activists, and volunteers reflect on Wikipedia’s first twenty years, revealing connections across disciplines and borders, languages and data, the professional and personal.
The contributors consider Wikipedia’s history, the richness of the connections that underpin it, and its founding vision. Their essays look at, among other things, the shift from bewilderment to respect in press coverage of Wikipedia; Wikipedia as “the most important laboratory for social scientific and computing research in history”; and the acknowledgment that “free access” includes not just access to the material but freedom to contribute—that the summation of all human knowledge is biased by who documents it.

	abstract = {Studying cultural variation in recollections of sociopolitical events is crucial for achieving diverse understandings of such events. To date, most studies in this area have focused on analyzing variation in texts describing events. Here, we analyze variation in image usage across Wikipedia language editions to understand if, like text, visual narratives reflect distinct perspectives in articles about culturally-tethered events. We focus on articles about coup d’états as an example of highly contextual sociopolitical events likely to display such variation. The key challenge to examining variation in images is that there is no existing framework to use as a basis for comparison. To address this challenge, we use an iterative inductive coding process to arrive at a 46-item typology for categorizing the content of images relating to contested sociopolitical events, and a typology of network motifs that characterizes structural patterns of image use. We apply these typologies in a large-scale quantitative analysis that establishes clusters of image themes, two detailed qualitative case studies comparing Wikipedia articles on coup d’états in Soviet Russia and Egypt, and four quantitative analyses clustering image themes by language usage at the article level. These analyses document variation in imagery around particular events and variation in tendencies across cultures. We find substantial cultural variation in both content and network structure. This study presents a novel methodological framework for uncovering culturally divergent perspective of political crises through imagery on Wikipedia.},

After its first release in July 2020, the Research team has developed the second complete draft of a taxonomy of knowledge gaps for the Wikimedia projects, as the first step towards building the knowledge gap index. We studied more than 250 references by scholars, researchers, practitioners, community members and affiliates -- exposing evidence of knowledge gaps in readership, contributorship, and content of Wikimedia projects. We elaborated the findings and compiled the taxonomy of knowledge gaps in this paper, where we describe, group and classify knowledge gaps into a structured framework. The taxonomy that you will learn more about in the rest of this work will serve as a basis to operationalize and quantify knowledge equity, one of the two 2030 strategic directions, through the knowledge gaps index.},

Examples include the use of NPOV-templates to automatically detect biased language in the content of Wikipedia [48, 123], or documenting biases in specific topics such as politics [34] or culture [20] among others. The Neutral point of view Noticeboard [259] is one of the main sub-communities dedicated to the discussion of neutrality of content in English Wikipedia.

In this paper, we analyze participation and attention to topics connected with the Black Lives Matter movement in the English language version of Wikipedia between 2014 and 2016. Our results point to the use of Wikipedia to (1) intensively document and connect historical and contemporary events, (2) collaboratively migrate activity to support coverage of new events, and (3) dynamically re-appraise pre-existing knowledge in the aftermath of new events. These findings reveal patterns of behavior that complement theories of collective memory and collective action and help explain how social computing systems can encode and retrieve knowledge about social movements as they unfold.},

	abstract = {Wikipedia (the “free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit”) is having a huge impact on how a great many people gather information about the world. So, it is important for epistemologists and information scientists to ask whether people are likely to acquire knowledge as a result of having access to this information source. In other words, is Wikipedia having good epistemic consequences? After surveying the various concerns that have been raised about the reliability of Wikipedia, this article argues that the epistemic consequences of people using Wikipedia as a source of information are likely to be quite good. According to several empirical studies, the reliability of Wikipedia compares favorably to the reliability of traditional encyclopedias. Furthermore, the reliability of Wikipedia compares even more favorably to the reliability of those information sources that people would be likely to use if Wikipedia did not exist (viz., Web sites that are as freely and easily accessible as Wikipedia). In addition, Wikipedia has a number of other epistemic virtues (e.g., power, speed, and fecundity) that arguably outweigh any deficiency in terms of reliability. Even so, epistemologists and information scientists should certainly be trying to identify changes (or alternatives) to Wikipedia that will bring about even better epistemic consequences. This article suggests that to improve Wikipedia, we need to clarify what our epistemic values are and to better understand why Wikipedia works as well as it does. Somebody who reads Wikipedia is “rather in the position of a visitor to a public restroom,” says Mr. McHenry, Britannica's former editor. “It may be obviously dirty, so that he knows to exercise great care, or it may seem fairly clean, so that he may be lulled into a false sense of security. What he certainly does not know is who has used the facilities before him.” One wonders whether people like Mr. McHenry would prefer there to be no public lavatories at all.

	abstract = {The article proposes to interpret the web-based encyclopaedia Wikipedia as a global memory place. After presenting the core elements and basic characteristics of wikis and Wikipedia respectively, the article discusses four related issues of social memory studies: collective memory, communicative and cultural memory, `memory places' and the `floating gap'. In a third step, these theoretical premises are connected to the understanding of discourse as social cognition. Fourth, comparison is made between the potential of the World Wide Web as cyberspace for collective remembrance and the obstacles that stand in its way. On this basis, the article argues that Wikipedia presents a global memory place where memorable elements are negotiated. Its complex processes of discussion and article creation are a model of the discursive fabrication of memory. Thus, they can be viewed and analysed as the transition, the `floating gap' between communicative and collective frames of memory.},

	abstract = {Many authors have argued that digital technologies enable collaboration without central oversight or authority, obviating the need for the hierarchical bureaucracies that characterize industrial capitalism. In this context, Wikipedia is often mentioned as a paradigmatic example. We draw on the classical accounts of Robert Michels and Max Weber to study mechanisms pushing towards or away from power concentration and bureaucratization. Our historical analysis of bureaucratization and power concentration in Wikipedia is based on 118 conversations and interviews as well as extensive archival research. While most studies on Wikipedia only consider the online encyclopedia itself, we also scrutinize the Wikimedia Foundation. Our analysis uncovers alternating processes of power concentration and power diffusion. While we observe power concentration for reasons anticipated by Michels, we also find strong counter-tendencies. Consequently, power concentration does not follow an ‘iron law’ but is the contingent outcome of struggles among stakeholders. In line with Weber, we identify a process of progressive bureaucratization. This does not only result from the pursuit of organizational manageability, but from a quest for democratic equality and minimization of domination as well. We introduce the concept of self-organizing bureaucratization to highlight how bureaucratization is the unintended and emergent outcome of efforts to increase democratic accountability.},

	abstract = {Research publishing involves the production, use and management of research in a variety of genres and formats by commercial and non-profit academic publishers, and by organizations in government, civil society, university and industry sectors. However discussion of research publishing mainly tends to focus on the production and circulation of peer-reviewed academic journals and to a lesser extent books produced by commercial academic publishers. Research reports and papers produced by organizations outside the formal publishing system play a critical role in the research and development (R\&D) system, yet they are often overlooked in studies on open scholarship and research communication. This is partly due to a lack of terminology to adequately describe the diverse publishing practices of organizations which operate across a spectrum from formal to informal economic activity. In this article I define and contextualise research publishing by organizations in relation to other forms of academic publishing and recent calls for greater bibliodiversity in scholarly communication. Commonly used terms such as ‘grey literature’ or ‘unpublished literature’ are inadequate to describe and account for the proliferation and importance of diverse research genres and formats able to be produced, published and disseminated in print and online by think tanks, government agencies, industry bodies and research centres. By taking a more holistic, systems-oriented approach to research publishing we can begin to understand the diverse actors, institutions and practices involved in knowledge production and develop appropriate policies, infrastructure and management practices to support an effective, efficient, equitable, credible and sustainable research knowledge commons in the public interest.},

	abstract = {It is hard to ignore the changes that have occurred to history-making in the digital age. Historians in the academy have observed, critiqued and, in some instances, engaged in the different forms of contemporary history that are related to the integration of the internet and related technologies into everyday lives. While digital history takes many forms, this paper examines Wikipedia as a mode of historical expression in the context of a project on the history of the Australian Paralympic Movement. Wikipedia’s key core content policies of verification, no original research, and neutral point of view (NPOV) as well as the collaborative premise that underpins the online encyclopaedia are the focal points of analysis. This analysis demonstrates that Wikipedia challenges historians who have traditionally produced the professionally approved artefacts of monographs and journal articles. In essence, Wikipedia requires historians to produce knowledge as part of a collaborative community of practice and, in the process, abandon popular theories of truth that underpin empirical-analytical history. Even given these challenges, the history of the Australian Paralympic Movement shows that Wikipedia can be important to history-making in the digital age in at least two ways. Wikipedia provides a mode of historical expression that is complementary to the narratives of traditional books, and the online encyclopaedia generates a community which has produced articles that have enhanced knowledge about the history of disability sport.},

“If emplotment is fundamental to the sense-making of history-writing and reading, how does the practice of collective writing affect the activity of emplotment in the construction of a historical text? Moreover, as digital representation is characterized by what Bertrans Gervais calls “hyperextension,”5 a “historical text” may no longer appear as a coherently structured narrative based on temporal unfolding. It now tends to present itself as “spatialized grids,” suggesting “multi-focal, multi-causal, and non-narrative modes of historical representation.”6” (Chiu, 2022, p. 219) *Update to Rosenzweig: Rosenzweig had argued that it was the literary aspects of history that were missing from Wikipedia. Chiu puts a different spin on this – what historians do is emplot the past. It would seem that Wikipedians don't do this.“With collective edits, corrections, and discussion, the constantly mutating narrative challenges “emplotment” as the essential activity of history-writing. It throws into sharp relief the problem of “fiction- making” in the construction of a historical narrative. The Musha Inci- dent article on Wikipedia departs from traditional history-writing in its insistent preservation of the traces of differently positioned contribu- tions in the making of the historical narrative. History is not configured as a good story told by a single author who imposes a coherent plot structure on a mass of incoherent material. Rather, Wikipedia history- writing is deliberately intended to be a work in progress, fraught with conflicting views and information that will be subject to further revi- sion. In short, it exposes how the complex mechanisms in historical representation work to produce a historical narrative.” (Chiu, 2022, p. 7)“The “Musha Incident” article on Wikipedia is different. “Historical text” and “historical narra- tive” are no longer synonyms. A Wikipedia “historical text” is presented as an unstable structure of ceaseless editing, hyperlinks, and statistics. Historical narrative is only part of this spatialized structure. Rather than being presented simply in terms of a narrative unfolding through time, a Wikipedia historical text participates in what Gervais calls the culture of hyperextension and it can be read on a computer screen only with all the material support of computing.20” (Chiu, 2022, p. 8)“That is, given that history is a collective enterprise rather than the work of a single author, the analysis of the position of the historian or the “emplotment” of the narrative is no longer possible. The central historiographical question becomes, instead, how collective history is produced not only through the interactions between humans and humans, but also between humans and machines.” (Chiu, 2022, p. 9) This is surely too stark a comparison. Why must emplotment be impossible if there are multiple authors? Why is it not the case that Wikipedia articles emplot history differently to traditional academic histories?“Thus, rather than focusing on plot and characterization as we used to do with print and filmic historical narrative, we have a new set of his- toriographical questions:” (Chiu, 2022, p. 18)“Log- ically, the material constraints of publishing in print should be an issue in studies of this kind.” (Chiu, 2022, p. 20)

	isbn = {978-1-315-13580-9},
	abstract = {This book is about how Australians have responded to stories about suffering and injustice in Australia, presented in a range of public media, including literature, history, films, and television. Those who have responded are both ordinary and prominent Australians—politicians, writers, and scholars. All have sought to come to terms with Australia's history by responding empathetically to stories of its marginalized citizens.Drawing upon international scholarship on collective memory, public history, testimony, and witnessing, this book represents a cultural history of contemporary Australia. It examines the forms of witnessing that dominated Australian public culture at the turn of the millennium. Since the late 1980s, witnessing has developed in Australia in response to the increasingly audible voices of indigenous peoples, migrants, and more recently, asylum seekers. As these voices became public, they posed a challenge not only to scholars and politicians, but also, most importantly, to ordinary citizens.When former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd delivered his historic apology to Australia's indigenous peoples in February 2008, he performed an act of collective witnessing that affirmed the testimony and experiences of Aboriginal Australians. The phenomenon of witnessing became crucial, not only to the recognition and reparation of past injustices, but to efforts to create a more cosmopolitan Australia in the present. This is a vital addition to Transaction's critically acclaimed Memory and Narrative series.},

Now, in an era of international terrorism, being seen as un-Australian' has become a potent rhetorical weapon for some, and a badge of honour for others.Catriona Elder explores the origins, meaning and effects of the many stories we tell about ourselves, and how they have changed over time. She outlines some of the traditional stories and their role in Australian nationalism, and she shows how concepts of egalitarianism, peaceful settlement and sporting prowess have been used to create a national identity. Elder also investigates the cultural and social perspectives that have been used to critique dominant accounts of Australian identity, including ideas of class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity and race. She shows how these critiques have been, in turn, queried in recent years. Being Australian is an ideal introduction to studying Australia for anyone interested in understanding Australian society, culture and history. A clever work: incisive and original. At a time when Australian identities have never been more debated, Elder finds an open way through the closed doors which often restrict cultural representations of Australian-ness.'Professor Adam Shoemaker, Dean of Arts, ANU This is a timely and significant new analysis essential reading on issues of identity and our own anxieties about national belonging and what it means to be Australian' in a globalising world.'Kate Darian-Smith, Professor of Australian Studies and History, University of Melbourne},

Making Australian History responds to this critical gap in Australian historical research.A few years ago Anna Clark saw a series of paintings on a sandstone cliff face in the Northern Territory. There were characteristic crosshatched images of fat barramundi and turtles, as well as sprayed handprints and several human figures with spears. Next to them was a long gun, painted with white ochre, an unmistakable image of the colonisers. Was this an Indigenous rendering of contact? A work of history?Each piece of history has a message and context that depends on who wrote it and when. Australian history has swirled and contorted over the years: the history wars have embroiled historians, politicians and public commentators alike, while debates over historical fiction have been as divisive. History isn't just about understanding what happened and why. It also reflects the persuasions, politics and prejudices of its authors. Each iteration of Australia's national story reveals not only the past in question, but also the guiding concerns and perceptions of each generation of history makers.Making Australian History is bold and inclusive: it catalogues and contextualises changing readings of the past, it examines the increasingly problematic role of historians as national storytellers, and it incorporates the stories of people},

This paper looks at two overarching questions on the debate between deletionists and inclusionists: (1) What are the implications to the long tail of the evolving standards for article birth and death? (2) How is viewership affected by the decreasing notability of articles in the long tail? The answers to five detailed research questions that are inspired by these overarching questions should help better frame this debate and provide insight into how Wikipedia is evolving.},

For example, English-language Wikipedia contains more than 1.5 million biographies about notable writers, inventors, and academics, but less than 19\% of these biographies are about women. To try and improve these statistics, activists host ?edit-a-thons? to increase the visibility of notable women. While this strategy helps create several biographies previously inexistent, it fails to address a more inconspicuous form of gender exclusion. Drawing on ethnographic observations, interviews, and quantitative analysis of web-scraped metadata, this article demonstrates that biographies about women who meet Wikipedia?s criteria for inclusion are more frequently considered non-notable and nominated for deletion compared to men?s biographies. This disproportionate rate is another dimension of gender inequality previously unexplored by social scientists and provides broader insights into how women?s achievements are (under)valued.},

	annote = {Summary: Tripodi demonstrates that more female biographies are nominated for deletion than men, even when accounting for whether they are actually notable. But “actually notable” is defined only in terms of whether the decision was to “keep” after the nomination was made. By this notion, the AFD process is seen as an objective way of determining someone’s notability, not as a unique, inconsistent with quirks and fallibility. 
In any case, Tripodi does well to focus on Wikipedia practice (in this case the AFD process) as lying at the heart of systemic bias on Wikipedia.
In her conclusion, she offers a number of possible explanations.  - women may occupy a lower status position in Wikipedia more broadly and less likely to hold admin roles;- OR that “this phenomenon is not exclusive to Wikipedia, and that women are considered less notable members of society more generally.” (14) 
Intro:
Tripodi argues that the application of Wikipedia’s notability guidelines plays “a critical role in the perpetuation of gender inequality on the site” (p2)
implications for how a person’s gender affects their perceived significance p2


“Given the increasing role Wikipedia plays in shaping Google’s search returns (Lewandowski and Spree, 2011; McMahon et al., 2017) and teaching AI systems (Robitzski, 2017), discrediting the significance of women subjects holds wider implications than just Wikipedia representation and provides a broader understanding of how women’s accomplishments are undervalued.” (Tripodi, 2021, p. 5)


argues that there has been little attention on how notability influences gender inequality 
Findings:
“Even though women still make up less than 19\% of all available biographies on English-language Wikipedia, women routinely make up a quarter of the biographies nominated for deletion each month.” (Tripodi, 2021, p. 10)
“Neglecting to follow a biography’s persistence means that women who have already established their credibility in a patriarchal system of accreditation might also “vanish” from our cultural memory (Luo et al., 2018).” (Tripodi, 2021, p. 9)
“the gender inequality observed in this and other studies is difficult to change and indicative of a larger structural problem” (Tripodi, 2021, p. 14) [what is this structure?] 
“Another explanation is that this phenomenon is not exclusive to Wikipedia, and that women are considered less notable members of society more generally.” (Tripodi, 2021, p. 14) [i.e. merely mirroring inequality discovered elsewhere] 
references: 
most frequent reason for deleting an article was that it had “no indication of importance” (Geiger and Ford, 2011: 201) and that deletions due to non-notability have increased over time (Lam and Read, 2009)
notability on wikipedia is “inconsistently enforced, arbitrarily assessed, and biased against women” (Gauthier and Sawchuk, 2017: 391; Kramer, 2019; Vitulli, 2017).” (Tripodi, 2021, p. 4)
women academics ae not more likely to be deleted (Adams et al., 2019) and female subjects who met wiki-notability criteria were more likely to be targeted for deletion (Tripodi, 2021, p. 4)

It investigates how cultures remember, arguing that human memory exists and is communicated in two ways, namely inter-human interaction and in external systems of notation, such as writing, which can span generations. Dr Assmann defines two theoretical concepts of cultural memory, differentiating between the long-term memory of societies, which can span up to 3,000 years, and communicative memory, which is typically restricted to 80 to 100 years. He applies this theoretical framework to case studies of four specific cultures, illustrating the function contexts and specific achievements, including the state, international law, religion and science. Ultimately, his research demonstrates that memory is not simply a means of retaining information, but rather a force that can shape cultural identity and allow cultures to respond creatively to both daily challenges and catastrophic changes.},

Her analysis also addresses the interaction of cultural memory with individual memory and the ways in which cultural memory supports or subverts social and political identity constructions.

	abstract = {Wikipedia has become increasingly prominent in online search results, serving as an initial path for the public to access ?facts,? and lending plausibility to its autobiographical claim to be ?the sum of all human knowledge.? However, this self-conception elides Wikipedia?s role as the world?s largest online site of encyclopedic knowledge production. A repository for established facts, Wikipedia is also a social space in which the facts themselves are decided. As a community, Wikipedia is guided by the five pillars?principles that inform and undergird the prevailing epistemic and social norms and practices for Wikipedia participation and contributions. We contend these pillars lend structural support to and help entrench Wikipedia?s gender gap as well as its lack of diversity in both participation and content. In upholding these pillars, Wikipedians may unknowingly undermine otherwise reasonable calls for inclusivity, subsequently reproducing systemic biases. We propose an alternative set of pillars developed through the lens of feminist epistemology, drawing on Lorraine Code?s notion of epistemic responsibility and Helen Longino?s notion of procedural objectivity. Our aim is not only to reduce bias, but also to make Wikipedia a more robust, reliable, and transparent site for knowledge production.},

Using a grounded theory approach, we detail the kinds of tasks women Wikipedians choose to do and explore why they choose the work they do. We also explore the emotional costs of their labor and their strategies for coping. Our analysis of 20 interviews leads us to posit that the gendered and emotional labor required of many women to participate in Wikipedia's production renders it, problematically, a space of conflicting public and private spheres, motivated by antithetical open and closed values. In addition to other contributions, we believe this insight sheds light on some of the complex dynamics behind Wikipedia's observed gender gap.},

	abstract = {The technologically tethered, iPhone-addicted figure is an image we can easily conjure. Most of us complain that there aren't enough hours in the day and too many e-mails in our thumb-accessible inboxes. This widespread perception that life is faster than it used to be is now ingrained in our culture, and smartphones and the Internet are continually being blamed. But isn't the sole purpose of the smartphone to give us such quick access to people and information that we'll be free to do other things? Isn't technology supposed to make our lives easier? In Pressed for Time, Judy Wajcman explains why we immediately interpret our experiences with digital technology as inexorably accelerating everyday life. She argues that we are not mere hostages to communication devices, and the sense of always being rushed is the result of the priorities and parameters we ourselves set rather than the machines that help us set them. Indeed, being busy and having action-packed lives has become valorized by our productivity driven culture. Wajcman offers a bracing historical perspective, exploring the commodification of clock time, and how the speed of the industrial age became identified with progress. She also delves into the ways time-use differs for diverse groups in modern societies, showing how changes in work patterns, family arrangements, and parenting all affect time stress. Bringing together empirical research on time use and theoretical debates about dramatic digital developments, this accessible and engaging book will leave readers better versed in how to use technology to navigate life's fast lane.},

In any given month, the site’s most popular articles — both in number of views and number of edits — are those reporting breaking news. Wikipedia’s protocols of ‘no original research’ mean the contributors must draw on the work of journalists, collating and re-purposing what has been published online. Taking as a case study the 2014 Sydney hostage crisis this paper analyzes Wikipedia’s breaking news practices and the ways the Internet is changing perceptions of news.},

Wikipedia’s editors form a “newsroom,” due to their hierarchy. Avieson’s aim is “to investigate the ways in which Wikipedians adopt the routine practices of journalists.”
The trajectory of the Sydney Siege article: “This provides insights into the processes of news becoming history as mediated by this increasingly popular collaborative platform.” Avieson claims that the article started off as “news-based” and became more “encyclopaedic” over time.
*The significance of removing the current event template: “This marks the point where Wikipedia stopped treating the siege as breaking news.” – It is equivalent to when traditional news organisations “stop following an event live.”
*Wikipedia’s contradictory temporality: “These points of view, which co-exist within the Wikipedia community, demonstrate how it is constantly being pulled in two directions — simultaneously situated in real time as well as the long term — which effectively blurs the boundaries of both news and temporality in reporting.”
“Wikipedia publishes both breaking news and historic information, and there is no identifiable point where one becomes the other.” – Does Wikipedia’s content count as ‘news’ then? What exactly is ‘breaking news’?
A quote from contributor WWGB: “A breaking story is becoming part of history because what happened half an hour ago is already the history of that event.” – History is half an hour ago!
*A contradiction in the “not a newspaper” policy: “The claim that breaking news should not be emphasized or treated differently doesn’t fit with the specific parameters set by their ‘current event’ template.” – This is maybe why the template has been so strictly policed on English Wikipedia.
Another quote from WWGB. He agrees with Avieson that Wikipedia articles go through distinct developmental phases with different rules: “It starts off as a breaking news, community service.”
Current events pages never escape their origins: “If the page were created today, I suggest it would be unlikely to reference those sources or be structured in the same way. The page in February 2018 carries the traces of its origins as a site for breaking news.”
“As a hybrid media system, embracing the ontology of both encyclopedias and newspapers, it collapses temporality and distinctions of news as a category, while also reinforcing the significant influence of that first draft of history in creating enduring narratives.”

The online presence of the writing of history is increasing, and this potential would be a welcome development for the field as it would create a much richer set of easily available historical perspectives. However, this article suggests that the achievement of this promise is fraught with difficulty and that a more likely outcome is a mapping of the status quo in historical representation onto the new media. To illustrate this, I present an analysis of the Wikipedia accounts of Singaporean and Philippine history. For Singapore, alternative historical visions are not as developed as those for the Philippines, and this is reflected in the nature of the respective Wikipedia accounts. I suggest that a possible means to achieve something more of the promise of digital media for history is for information professionals to take a keener interest in Wikipedia, with an eye to helping include accounts of documented historical perspectives that are ignored by mainstream historiographical traditions.},

	abstract = {The growing influence of English Wikipedia as a provider of information has created powerful new gatekeepers and publishing practices that determine not only what constitutes knowledge in the online world, but whose knowledge is privileged. The structural inequalities of the offline world are being reproduced online, creating new sites for information imperialism. Research shows western contributors are overwriting local knowledge, perpetuating western narratives, and presenting cultures through an outsider lens, resulting in subtle and not so subtle forms of hegemonic cultural dominance. Nonetheless, Wikipedias have multi-media capabilities, which can be utilized by oral cultures as well as providing new asynchronous online meeting places where communities can continue their social imaginings. This paper considers the impacts of English Wikipedia on global knowledge equity and cognitive justice. It analyzes two articles about Bhutanese culture to demonstrate the risks of dilution brought by western ontological expansiveness, and argues that, by contrast, the Dzongkha Wikipedia offers an online space mostly inaccessible to outsiders, and thus a bulwark where the community can continue its cultural conversations in ways not possible before Web 2.0 technologies.},

While these Wikipedia articles are easily accessible, they have unknown provenance and reliability and therefore using them in professional settings is problematic. Nevertheless, Wikipedia articles influence legal judgments, as we show using a randomized control trial.We find that the presence of a Wikipedia article about Irish Supreme Court decisions makes it meaningfully more likely that the corresponding case will be cited as a precedent by judges in subsequent decisions. The language used in the Wikipedia article also influences the language used in judgments. These effects are only present for citations by the High Court, not for the higher levels of the judiciary (Court of Appeal and Supreme Court). Since the High Court faces higher caseloads, this may indicate that settings with greater time pressures encourage greater reliance on Wikipedia.Our results add to the growing recognition that Wikipedia and other frequently-accessed sources of user-generated content have profound effects on important social outcomes. Greater attention should therefore be paid to ensuring that they contain the highest quality of information.},

Here we analyse material from Wikipedia, focusing on schizophrenia genetics. We find that citation and curation of scientific resources follow a negotiated, ad hoc adherence to Wikipedia rules, are based on limited access to scientific literature, and thus lead to a partially constructed ‘review’ of the science that excludes non-professionals. Given its policies and systems for developing neutral, evidence-based articles, one would not expect to find controversy on Wikipedia, yet we find traces. Scientific ambiguity about schizophrenia genetics lends itself to multiple ways of curating resources, and the infrastructure of online spaces enables the practices behind curation work to become visible in new ways. We argue that not only does Wikipedia make scientific controversy visible to a wider range of people, it is also involved in the production of knowledge.},

This bias not only shapes social perceptions of knowledge, but it can also propagate beyond the platform as its contents are leveraged to correct misinformation, train machine-learning tools, and enhance search engine results. What happens when feminist movements intervene to try to close existing gaps? Through a quantitative analysis of over 11,000 Wikipedia articles, we provide an evaluation of two popular feminist interventions designed to counteract gender inequality within digital information projects. We find that the interventions are successful at adding content about women that would otherwise be missing, but they are less successful at addressing structural biases that limit the visibility of that content. This leads us to argue for a more granular and cumulative analysis of gender gaps in collaborative environments. We also discuss the implications for future scholarship on digital inequalities.},

While prior research has examined man/woman gender bias in biography articles, possible influences of other demographic attributes limit conclusions. In this work, we present a methodology for analyzing Wikipedia pages about people that isolates dimensions of interest (e.g., gender), from other attributes (e.g., occupation). Given a target corpus for analysis (e.g. biographies about women), we present a method for constructing a comparison corpus that matches the target corpus in as many attributes as possible, except the target one. We develop evaluation metrics to measure how well the comparison corpus aligns with the target corpus and then examine how articles about gender and racial minorities (cis. women, non-binary people, transgender women, and transgender men; African American, Asian American, and Hispanic/Latinx American people) differ from other articles. In addition to identifying suspect social biases, our results show that failing to control for covariates can result in different conclusions and veil biases. Our contributions include methodology that facilitates further analyses of bias in Wikipedia articles, findings that can aid Wikipedia editors in reducing biases, and a framework and evaluation metrics to guide future work in this area.},

Anyone with access to the Web is able to play a part on Wikipedia, an open and free encyclopedia, and arguably one of the primary sources of knowledge on the Web. In this paper, we study gender bias in Wikipedia in terms of how women and men are characterized in their biographies. To do so, we analyze biographical content in three aspects: meta-data, language, and network structure. Our results show that, indeed, there are differences in characterization and structure. Some of these differences are reflected from the off-line world documented by Wikipedia, but other differences can be attributed to gender bias in Wikipedia content. We contextualize these differences in social theory and discuss their implications for Wikipedia policy.},

	abstract = {The recent Facebook study about emotional contagion has generated a high-profile debate about the ethical and social issues in Big Data research. These issues are not unprecedented, but the debate highlighted that, in focusing on research ethics and the legal issues about this type of research, an important larger picture is overlooked about the extent to which free will is compatible with the growth of deterministic scientific knowledge, and how Big Data research has become central to this growth of knowledge. After discussing the ?emotional contagion study? as an illustration, these larger issues about Big Data and scientific knowledge are addressed by providing definitions of data, Big Data and of how scientific knowledge changes the human-made environment. Against this background, it will be possible to examine why the uses of data-driven analyses of human behaviour in particular have recently experienced rapid growth. The essay then goes on to discuss the distinction between basic scientific research as against applied research, a distinction which, it is argued, is necessary to understand the quite different implications in the context of scientific as opposed to applied research. Further, it is important to recognize that Big Data analyses are both enabled and constrained by the nature of data sources available. Big Data research is bound to become more widespread, and this will require more awareness on the part of data scientists, policymakers and a wider public about its contexts and often unintended consequences.},

Such projects, and the edit-a-thons that continue to be convened in Wadewitz’s honour, help to reconcile the imbalance and simultaneously present pedagogical opportunities. Drawing upon scholarly literature, this paper also illustrates how Wikipedia editing supports and reinforces the principles of both academic and public writing and represents an open and sustainable platform for formative and summative assessment. Moreover, the paper emphasises the superiority of digital informative texts created by mass-collaboration and participation over those compiled by individuals or through small group collaboration, both of which delimit the homogeneity of networked knowledge.},

In this commentary, we propose moving the research focus beyond bias-oriented framings by adopting a power-aware perspective to "study up" ML datasets. This means accounting for historical inequities, labor conditions, and epistemological standpoints inscribed in data. We draw on HCI and CSCW work to support our argument, critically analyze previous research, and point at two co-existing lines of work within our research community {\textbackslash},---{\textbackslash},one bias-centered, the other power-aware. We highlight the need for dialogue and cooperation in three areas: data quality, data work, and data documentation. In the first area, we argue that reducing societal problems to "bias" misses the context-based nature of data. In the second one, we highlight the corporate forces and market imperatives involved in the labor of data workers that subsequently shape ML datasets. Finally, we propose expanding current transparency-oriented efforts in dataset documentation to reflect the social contexts of data design and production.},

	abstract = {This paper questions the dichotomy of work/nonwork. It examines the way in which the category of work was expanded by feminists and economists to include much domestic activity, and considers some of the consequences of this expansion. It argues that the discovery of unpaid "work" involved an uncritical application and validation of a concept of work abstracted from a model of commodity producing wage labor in manufacturing. However, this concept excludes much of what is distinctive about domestic activities, such as their caring and self-fulfilling aspects. Inequality between households has become a conduit for the construction of needs in a form in which "work," and in particular work for money, is needed to satisfy them. Some consequences of this tendency are examined together with the policy concerns which would need to be addressed in order to mitigate its deleterious effects. The development of a feminist economics which transcends the polarization of life into "work" and "nonwork" is argued to be vital in this process.},

	abstract = {In 1968, the Australian anthropologist W. E. H. Stanner famously articulated that the nation’s history had been wracked by a ‘great Australian silence’ with regard to the recognition of Indigenous experience. Australia’s sense of its past, he argued, its very collective memory, had been built on a state of forgetting. Beyond that disciplinary silence, however, important historical ‘noise’ was being made about Indigenous history. Popular historical fiction and poetry, Indigenous family histories and forms of popular protest all offered important counter-narratives to that formal silence from the History discipline. Scholarship in the fields of anthropology and archaeology further pressed against the silences and silencing of Australian History. This paper uses the idea of silence to complicate historiographical space in Australia. By contemplating formal History texts, vernacular historical accounts and history-making beyond the discipline, it seeks to extend our understandings of national historiographies and historical knowledge.},

	abstract = {This essay uncovers the systematic, intentional distortion of Holocaust history on the English-language Wikipedia, the world’s largest encyclopedia. In the last decade, a group of committed Wikipedia editors have been promoting a skewed version of history on Wikipedia, one touted by right-wing Polish nationalists, which whitewashes the role of Polish society in the Holocaust and bolsters stereotypes about Jews. Due to this group’s zealous handiwork, Wikipedia’s articles on the Holocaust in Poland minimize Polish antisemitism, exaggerate the Poles’ role in saving Jews, insinuate that most Jews supported Communism and conspired with Communists to betray Poles (Żydokomuna or Judeo–Bolshevism), blame Jews for their own persecution, and inflate Jewish collaboration with the Nazis. To explain how distortionist editors have succeeded in imposing this narrative, despite the efforts of opposing editors to correct it, we employ an innovative methodology. We examine 25 public-facing Wikipedia articles and nearly 300 of Wikipedia’s back pages, including talk pages, noticeboards, and arbitration cases. We complement these with interviews of editors in the field and statistical data gleaned through Wikipedia’s tool suites. This essay contributes to the study of Holocaust memory, revealing the digital mechanisms by which ideological zeal, prejudice, and bias trump reason and historical accuracy. More broadly, we break new ground in the field of the digital humanities, modelling an in-depth examination of how Wikipedia editors negotiate and manufacture information for the rest of the world to consume.},

How are crowd-enabled networks activated, structured, and maintained in the absence of recognized leaders, common goals, or conventional organization, issue framing, and action coordination? We develop an analytical framework for examining the organizational processes of crowd-enabled connective action such as was found in the Arab Spring, the 15-M in Spain, and Occupy Wall Street. The analysis points to three elemental modes of peer production that operate together to create organization in crowds: the production, curation, and dynamic integration of various types of information content and other resources that become distributed and utilized across the crowd. Whereas other peer-production communities such as open-source software developers or Wikipedia typically evolve more highly structured participation environments, crowds create organization through packaging these elemental peer-production mechanisms to achieve various kinds of work. The workings of these ‘production packages’ are illustrated with a theory-driven analysis of Twitter data from the 2011–2012 US Occupy movement, using an archive of some 60 million tweets. This analysis shows how the Occupy crowd produced various organizational routines, and how the different production mechanisms were nested in each other to create relatively complex organizational results.},

For example, when the volume of crowd activity tails off, indicating that protests may be dying out, how do actors respond? Does the pattern of production (who produces what) change? Do patterns of curation (who retweets or follows whom) change? Do strategies for dynamic (re)integration change (how many of what hashtags are attached to particular patterns of production and curation)? 
The capacity for coherent organization of crowd-enabled protest networks hinges on how core contributors and more peripheral participants work together to produce the package of elemental organizing processes.
in-network authority may also shift over time as recognition grows or the needs of the crowds change: curation processes may ‘crowdsource to prominence’ non-elite actors on the basis of their in-network contributions

Thousands of people provided their contribution on the content pages and discussed improvements and disagreements on the associated talk pages as the traumatic events unfolded. We propose to interpret this phenomenon as a process of collective memory building and argue how on Wikipedia this can be studied empirically and quantitatively in real time.

	abstract = {Is, as Hamlet once complained, time out joint? Have the ways we understand the past and the future—and their relationship to the present—been reordered? The past, it seems, has returned with a vengeance: as aggressive nostalgia, as traumatic memory, or as atavistic origin narratives rooted in nation, race, or tribe. The future, meanwhile, has lost its utopian glamor, with the belief in progress and hope for a better future eroded by fears of ecological collapse. In this provocative book, Aleida Assmann argues that the apparently solid moorings of our temporal orientation have collapsed within the span of a generation. To understand this profound cultural crisis, she reconstructs the rise and fall of what she calls "time regime of modernity" that underpins notions of modernization and progress, a shared understanding that is now under threat. Is Time Out of Joint? assesses the deep change in the temporality of modern Western culture as it relates to our historical experience, historical theory, and our life-world of shared experience, explaining what we have both gained and lost during this profound transformation.},

“automated software agents already have a similar level of influence on how Wikipedia as a free and open ency- clopedia project is constituted.” (Geiger, 2011, p. 2)“Even bots that perform seemingly routine and uncontroversial tasks, like importing census data into articles about cities and towns, often incorporate high-level epistemic as- sumptions about how an encyclopedia ought to be constructed.” (Geiger, 2011, p. 2) “epistemic” aspects of bots“In such a view, bots do not perform normative enforcement of standards. Rather, ‘power editors’ use bots – along with rules and templates – in the same way that a police officer uses a car, ticket book, legal code, and a radar gun to perform a more efficient and standardized form of normative enforcement. W” (Geiger, 2011, p. 3) One view of bots: they are the avatars of “power editors”, who use them to impose their views“Bots, like infrastructures in general, 23 simultaneously produce and rely upon a particular vision of how the world is and ought to be, a regime of delegation that often sinks into the background – that is, until they do not perform as expected and generate intense controversies. In these moments of sociotechnical breakdown, these worldviews are articulated in both material and semiotic modes, and are rarely reconciled by either purely technological or discursive means.” (Geiger, 2011, p. 4) Bots can be hard to observe, because they are inconspicuous. One method for observing them: look at moments of breakdown or controversy“There were a few problems with the bot’s identification algorithms, making it malfunction in certain areas: programming errors that Hagerman promptly fixed. However, some users were annoyed with the bot’s normal functioning, complaining that it instantly signed their comments instead of giving them time to sign their own comments after the fact.” (Geiger, 2011, p. 5) Bugs vs functions – not so clear cut“From a design standpoint, HagermanBot thus assumed total editorial compliance with the Signatures guideline: the two opt-out features were to ensure more conformity, not less, by allowing users to tell the bot when a Signature would be unwarranted according to the guideline. Users who were opposed to the Signatures guideline in general could use the tedious feature to prevent the bot from enforcing the guideline when they made comments, but Hagerman begged them not to opt- out in this manner.” (Geiger, 2011, p. 6) Not was designed to enact a particular guideline: thus dispute over the guideline became a dispute over the bot“As seen in Hagerman’s reply to this objection, a few human allies were helpful in rebutting the objections made against his bot: the members of the Bot Approval Group, who had reviewed and approved the bot according to established protocols. The Signatures guide- line – including the distinction between guidelines and policies – was also invoked to justify HagermanBot’s actions, as shown in both examples. It would seem that these actors, who were generally taken to draw their legitimacy from a broad, project-wide consensus, would have been the most powerful allies that Hagerman could deploy in support of HagermanBot’s actions and its vision of how discussion spaces in Wikipedia ought to operate” (Geiger, 2011, p. 7) Bot supported by “human allies”“However, a much stronger ally proved to be the opt-out list through which angry editors could be made to lose interest in the debate altogether” (Geiger, 2011, p. 7) More powerful “actor” (Latour): the bot’s opt-out feature“The case of HagermanBot shows us how a weak but pre-existing social norm was controver- sially reified into a technological actor” (Geiger, 2011, p. 8)“This is because, like Bruno Latour’s speed bumps, bots are ruthlessly moral; just as a speed bump will punish both reckless driv- ers and ambulances in its quest to maintain order on roads, so will bots often take a particular view of Wikipedia to its logical extreme. This makes it difficult to think of bot operators as power users who silently deploy bots to further increase their power in the community.” (Geiger, 2011, p. 8)“In understanding the relationship that bots have to the world around them, we must trace how bots come to articulate and be articulated within a heterogeneous assemblage. Only then can we realize that the question of who or what is in control of Wikipedia is far less interesting than the question of how control operates across a diverse and multi-faceted sociotechnical environment.” (Geiger, 2011, p. 9)

“In this framework, if one bot developer believed that images without a properly-formatted fair-use rationale ought to be removed from articles, and other bot developer believed that such images ought to remain in articles, this would be task conflict. However, if both bot developers believed that such images ought to be removed from articles but had different ideas about what a properly-formatted fair use rationale looks like, this would be process conflict. And if a bot developer got angry at another bot developer and wrote a bot to undo all of their previous edits, this would be relationship conflict.” (Geiger and Halfaker, 2017, p. 4) A typology of possible bot conflicts: task conflict, process conflict, relationship conflict.“How can a research team both dive deep into the complexity of particular cases and scale up to the massive size of a dataset like those found in contemporary social computing platforms?” (Geiger and Halfaker, 2017, p. 6) The central problem for mixed-methods analyses of Wikipedia.“Drawing on classic CSCW literature about conflict and cooperation [15, 48], we do not believe that the mere presence of conflict between bots or even between Wikipedians about bots means that the Wikipedian community is somehow failing in the area of automation regulation. It is more useful and generative to ask what happens when such conflict arises, as successful and prompt conflict resolution is a sign of a healthy and developed organization.” (Geiger and Halfaker, 2017, p. 26)“At a broader level, one of the starkest differences between our study and the EGBF study is that for us, bots are inextricably linked to their developers, rather than autonomous agents who can be studied independently of the people who develop and operate them.” (Geiger and Halfaker, 2017, p. 26) How does this fit with Geiger's analysis elsewhere of bots as 'actors' in a Latourian actor-network?“Our mixed-methods approach is an integrative, iterative synthesis, not a coordinated pluralism: there is a column in a dataframe that would not exist without ethnography, as well as thick descriptions of cases that were found by sampling from the extreme ends of a statistical distribution.” (Geiger and Halfaker, 2017, p. 27)

	abstract = {Scholars and practitioners across domains are increasingly concerned with algorithmic transparency and opacity, interrogating the values and assumptions embedded in automated, black-boxed systems, particularly in user-generated content platforms. I report from an ethnography of infrastructure in Wikipedia to discuss an often understudied aspect of this topic: the local, contextual, learned expertise involved in participating in a highly automated social–technical environment. Today, the organizational culture of Wikipedia is deeply intertwined with various data-driven algorithmic systems, which Wikipedians rely on to help manage and govern the ‘‘anyone can edit’’ encyclopedia at a massive scale. These bots, scripts, tools, plugins, and dashboards make Wikipedia more efficient for those who know how to work with them, but like all organizational culture, newcomers must learn them if they want to fully participate. I illustrate how cultural and organizational expertise is enacted around algorithmic agents by discussing two autoethnographic vignettes, which relate my personal experience as a veteran in Wikipedia. I present thick descriptions of how governance and gatekeeping practices are articulated through and in alignment with these automated infrastructures. Over the past 15 years, Wikipedian veterans and administrators have made specific decisions to support administrative and editorial workflows with automation in particular ways and not others. I use these cases of Wikipedia’s bot-supported bureaucracy to discuss several issues in the fields of critical algorithms studies; critical data studies; and fairness, accountability, and transparency in machine learning—most principally arguing that scholarship and practice must go beyond trying to ‘‘open up the black box’’ of such systems and also examine sociocultural processes like newcomer socialization.},

“Bots in Wikipedia: An understudied data consumer of the Wikipedia corpus” (Geiger, 2017, p. 3)“Scholars in this area have argued that Wikipedia’s unexpected success in the face of few top-down management structures is not due to a ‘‘wisdom of crowds,’’ but rather a wisdom of bots, algorithmic agents, and smart interfaces that help structure the work of coordination behind the scenes, in the absence of formal, top-down management (Niederer and Van Dijck 2010; Geiger 2011a; Halfaker and Riedl, 2012).” (Geiger, 2017, p. 3)“Extending this, I argue that the bots, automated tools, and encoded routines that undergird participation in Wikipedia are as much a part of Wikipedia’s particular organizational culture as more traditionally social or cultural elements like jargon, norms, ideologies, epistemologies, argumentative styles, subcultural configurations which have been extensively studied by sociocultural researchers and are continually reflected on by Wikipedians themselves.” (Geiger, 2017, p. 3)“Following Seaver (2013), I focus not on ‘‘algorithms’’ in the abstract but on ‘‘algorithmic systems’’—how these encoded procedures are deployed in a complex social–technical context.” (Geiger, 2017, p. 4) Difference between ''algorithms" and "algorithmic systems"“To see a system ‘‘in the making’’ is the classic denaturalization move continually made by ethnographers and historians of science and technology who investigate the messy work and competing perspectives that are often obscured when a product goes to market or a paper goes to a scientific journal.” (Geiger, 2017, p. 5)“To nominate an article for speedy deletion is to add a template like \{\{db-web\}\} to the top of an article, and vice versa, making it a kind of performative utterance (Austin, 1976)” (Geiger, 2017, p. 6) Adding a template is an illocutionary act“Wikipedians who use algorithmically assisted tools and extensions like Twinkle are best understood as cyborgs (Halfaker and Riedl, 2012), with their experiences and affordances extended in particular ways and not others.” (Geiger, 2017, p. 7)“However, both speedy deletion and edit requests rest on a similar assemblage: ideals and values are implemented in policies and rules, which define an organizational process, which is encoded in software that is built to help support Wikipedians.” (Geiger, 2017, p. 9) Bots form "assemblages" with "ideals", "values", "policies" and "rules" – this assemblage is an "organizational process"“Because of this, much of the relatively high quality and internal consistency of Wikipedia should be attributed as much to ‘‘wisdom of bots’’ as is attributed to the frequently cited ‘‘wisdom of crowds.’’” (Geiger, 2017, p. 9) **quotable on the "wisdom of bots"“The speedy deletion process is formalized in a policy that is also written in English text, to help Wikipedians collectively interpret and apply these criteria in a standardized way. Yet the speedy deletion process is also formalized in the bots and tools that have been built to help automate, streamline, and standardize participation in this particular process.” (Geiger, 2017, p. 10) Two ways to "formalize" a process: (1) in a formal document; (2) with a bot.“However, it is important to note that nowhere in these two vignettes was it relevant for me to discuss how the source code of every single piece of software mentioned is publicly available for review.” (Geiger, 2017, p. 10) Interesting point: the open-sourceness of Wikipedia bots is not always relevant“What distinguishes myself as a veteran from a newcomer is not my access to the specific lines of code that specify how a particular browser extension automates a particular task, but rather how much expertise and familiarity I have working with these kinds of processes in this particular organizational culture.” (Geiger, 2017, p. 11) A person's mental model of a bot is more important than their knowledge of the source code.

“Wikipedia has shifted from being a collaborative project experimenting with the online production of encyclopedic knowledge, to being a professionally run, volunteer-based, nonprofit organization whose goal is the online production of an encyclopedia” (Dijck, 2013, p. 132)“Over the first ten years of its existence, many have acclaimed Wikipedia’s laudable goals and successful nonprofit organization, but some also criticized its gradual institutionalization.” (Dijck, 2013, p. 133)“In sum, what defines the encyclopedia’s success for some people embodies disenchantment for others.” (Dijck, 2013, p. 133)“the real wisdom of Wikipedia can be found not in its crowds but in its crowd management.” (Dijck, 2013, p. 134) cf. Geiger – wisdom of policy/process/procedure/organisation rather than wisdom of random individuals“Vandal fighting in Wikipedia is a process of distributed cognition, made possible by a “complex network of interactions between humans, encyclopedia articles, software systems and databases” (Geiger and Ribes 2010: 118).” (Dijck, 2013, p. 138)“It is an integral system of human-bot interaction that helps produce and maintain a kind of modulated sociality, which is unprecedented in scale: Wikipedia’s engineered social order structures collaboration of thousands of active contributors, hundreds of bots, and millions of readers who are also potential contributors.” (Dijck, 2013, p. 139)“the process of creating Wikipedia fosters an appreciation of the very skills that historians try to teach” (138)” (Dijck, 2013, p. 142) Rosenzweig suggests that the process of editing Wikipedia engenders historicity in Pietsch's sense“Viewed in this light, the neutrality principle shows at least some likeness to the popularity principle employed by Google and Facebook. Some Wikipedians have countered this criticism saying that the NPoV principle may at times be untenable, especially in those situations when a disinterested position is impossible, but in general, it works as a functional guideline for processing content.” (Dijck, 2013, p. 143)“By dividing the Wikimedia Foundation from the encyclopedic project, it strictly adhered to a separation of fund-raising and editorial activities, but the inequity between the two entities felt awkward to some people.” (Dijck, 2013, p. 144) The complexity of Wikipedia's non-profit structure“Social scientist Mathieu O’Neil, for instance, argues that the semilegal system of regulations and bylaws was not democratically formed, and that Wikipedia defies any democratic potential as long as it lacks a constitution and clearly defined voting procedures (O’Neil 2011: 321).” (Dijck, 2013, p. 146) People who think democracy = voting don't think Wikipedia is very democratic...“the project is neither anarchy nor monarchy, nor can it be called a democracy or bureaucracy,” (Dijck, 2013, p. 146) What about "aristocracy"? Don't editors obtain power by being recognised as "excellent" by their peers?“Konieczny proposes to apply the concept “adhocracy” to the online encyclopedia’s organization.” (Dijck, 2013, p. 146)“n contrast to ephemeral messages and trending topics, online encyclopedic entries are built to last, and yet they are as dynamic and flexible as van, D.

The coffee houses of eighteenth-century London were for-profit enterprises, after all, as were the magazines and coffee merchants who supplied the coffee-houses' main products!

Les deux termes qui forme contraste sont l’effacement (l’oubli) et la conservation; la mémoire est, toujours et nécessairement, une interaction des deux. … la mémoire, elle, est forcément une sélection … C’est bien pourquoi il est profondément déroulant de voir appeler ‘mémoire’ la capacité qu’ont les ordinateurs de conserver l’information: il manque, à cette dernière opération un trait constitutif de la mémoire, à savoir la sélection.” (p. 14)
Progress and futurity dominate western societies, not memory: “Ensuite, le fait que la mémoire s’y articule avec d’autres principes directeurs: la volonté, le consentement, le raisonnement, la création, la liberté. Il est clair enfin que, dans les sociétés occidentales, le mémoire n’occupe pas, en règle générale, une position dominante. Que dire alors de la sphère des conduites publiques, éthiques et politiques?” (p. 22)
Two types of memory: “Main on peut aussi, et c’est l’hypothèse que je voudrais explorer ici, fonder la critique des usages de la mémoire dans une distinction entres plusieurs formes de réminiscence. L’événement recouvré peut être lu soit de manière littérale soit de manière exemplaire.” (p. 29) – Literal = unique. The event is just itself and nothing else. Exemplary = a member of a class. The event is like many other events, and can be used to understand what is happening now. 
Todorov’s preference for ‘exemplary’ memory is interesting. His view can usefully be compared to Oakeshott and Yerushalmi. Oakeshott basically argued in favour of ‘literal’ memory, when he suggested that the historical mode of knowledge has no concern with the present. It is, or should be, purely focused on the reconstruction of the past, and shouldn’t be used to try and change or affect the present. This is similar to Yerushalmi’s idea of “historical criticism,” as a fundamental activity underlying “historiography.” The historian reconstructs the past on the basis of research, and pursues the evidence even when it would rob history of its “meaning.” By contrast, according to Yerushalmi, “memory” is freer to assign “meaning” to the past – I suggest his concept of “meaning” is something like Todorov’s concept of “exemplarity,” but perhaps it isn’t.
Literal vs exemplary explained: “L’usage littéral, qui rend l’événement ancien indépassable, revient en fin de compte à soumettre le présent au passé. L’usage exemplaire, en revanche, permet d’utiliser le passé en vue du présent, de se servir des leçons, des injustices subies pour combattre celles qui ont cours aujourd’hui, de quitter le soi pour aller vers l’autre.” (p. 31)
The cult of memory: “En cette fin de millénaire, les Européens, et tout particulièrement les Français, sont obsédés pas un nouveau culte, celui de la mémoire. Comme s’ils étaient saisis de nostalgie pour un passé qui s’éloigne irrévocablement, ils s’adonnent avec ferveur à des rites conjuratoires, censés le maintenir vivant. On inaugure, paraît-il, un musée par jour en Europe, et des activités naguère utilitaires deviennent maintenant objet de contemplation …” (p. 50) – He goes on, making funny quotable remarks.
One reason for the cult of memory: modernsation. “La réunion de ces deux conditions – le besoin d’identité collective, la destruction des identités traditionelles – est responsable, en partie, du nouveau culte de la mémoire: c’est en se constituant un passé commun qu’on pourra bénéficier de la reconnaissance due au groupe.” (p. 52)
Another reason for the cult of memory: to ignore present ills. “Un autre raison pour se préoccuper du passé est que cela nous permet de nous détourner du présent, tout en nous procurant les bénéfices de la bonne conscience.” (p. 53)

Yerushalmi sets out to distinguish three “elements” of our apprehension of the past:


memory – or remembering


historiography – or recording


the meaning of history


He also, however, refers throughout the book to two other concepts


history - or the past? the passage of time?


historical criticism


And there is also the question of the activity that memory, historiography, and the meaning of history have in common – that is, the apprehension of the past. Is this what he means by the general term “history”? So there could be as many as six elements to Yerushalmi’s argument…
Preface to 1989 edition
p. xxx – Mention of a book “Usages de l’oubli”, which sounds interesting
Prologue to the Original Edition
p. xxxiii – “At the very heart of this book lies an attempt to understand what seemed a paradox to me at one time—that although Judaism throughout the ages was absorbed with the meaning of history, historiography itself played at best an ancillary role among the Jews, and often no role at all; and, concomitantly, that while memory of the past was always a central component of Jewish experience, the historian was not its primary custodian.”
Chapter 1. Biblical and Rabbinical Foundations
pp. 5-6 – “The apparent irony is not limited to Jews alone. It is our common experience that what is remembered is not always {\textbar} recorded, and, alas for the historian, that much of what is recorded is not necessarily remembered.”
p. 14 – “We have learned, in effect, that meaning in history, memory of the past, and the writing of history are by no means to be equated. In the Bible, to be sure, the three elements are linked, they overlap at critical points, and, in general, they are held together by a web of delicate and reciprocal relationships. In post-biblical Judaism, as we shall see, they pull asunder.”
*p. 21 – Jewish memory was unconcerned with current events: “We will state it as simply as possible. If the rabbis, wise men who had inherited a powerful historical tradition, were no longer interested in mundane history, this indicates nothing more than that they felt no need to cultivate it. Perhaps they already knew of history what they needed to know. Perhaps they were even wary of it.” – Why are Wikipedians so obsessed with recording the present? Clearly this is not a universal impulse of human beings…
p. 24 – How does history become meaningful? “Then as now, history did not validate itself and reveal its meaning imminently. In the biblical period the meaning of specific historical events had been laid bare by the inner eye of prophecy, but that was no longer possible. If the rabbis were successors to the prophets they did not themselves lay claim to prophecy.” – Yerushalmi seems to be using “history” in the sense of “history-in-itself” or “the past.” In fact, throughout the book he prefers the term “historiography” to denote the thing historians do.
Chapter 2. The Middle Ages
p. 34 – Historiography is not a necessary social institution: “I do not happen to be among those who, even now, would fault medieval Jewry for writing relatively little history. Far from indicating a gap or flaw in their civilization, it may well reflect a self-sufficiency that ours no longer possesses.” – Do Wikipedia and the “cult of memory” (Todorov) represent a lack of “self-sufficiency”? Critics of identity politics would say so (e.g. Castells); what might supporters of identity politics think?
p. 34 – “The relevant past, however, other than that which may have been experienced directly and personally, was clearly the remote past. What had happened long ago had determined what had occurred since, and even provided the fundamental explanations for what was still transpiring.” – Does history occupy the middle distance, then, between myth and living memory? The old “floating gap”…
Chapter 3. In the wake of the Spanish Expulsion
p. 69 – Another concept: “historical criticism.” Yerushalmi is discussing Azariah de’ Rossi’s book, Me’or ‘Einayim. “Unlike so many other books written by Italian Jews that display a veneer of humanistic learning, here the humanist spirit has penetrated the very vitals of the work, and only here do we find the real beginnings of historical criticism.” – Yerushalmi goes on to discuss to identify de Rossi’s non-sectarian treatment of sources as the key to his “historical criticism.”
Chapter 4. Modern dilemmas
p. 86 – “The modern attempt to reconstruct the Jewish past begins at a time that witnesses a sharp break in the continuity of Jewish living and hence also an ever-growing decay of Jewish group memory. In this sense, if for no other, history becomes what it had never been before—the faith of fallen Jews. For the first time history, not a sacred text, becomes the arbiter of Judaism.”
p. 88 – Historiography and nationalism – a more complex story: “More tragic and significant was the contrast between the respective context within which Jewish and gentile historians operated. The golden age of European historiography in the first half the nineteenth century coincided with the dawn of modern nationalism and drew much of its élan from it. The German or French historian had a vital and honored place in the process of national awakening. At the very same time, however, Europe was demanding of the Jews that, as a condition for their emancipation, they cease to regard themselves as a nation and redefine themselves in purely religious terms.”
*p. 91 – The temporality of western historiography: “Western man’s discovery of history is not a mere interest in the past, which always existed, but a new awareness, a perception of a fluid temporal dimension form which nothing is exempt.”
p. 93 – A quote from Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy, “The historian is the physician of memory …” Worth looking up the quote in his Out of Revolution (1964), p. 696
p. 94 – In response to Rosenstock-Huessy: “But for the wounds inflected upon Jewish life by the disintegrative blows of the last two hundred years the historian seems at best a pathologist, hardly a physician.”
**pp. 94-95 – Memory vs. modern historiography: “Memory and modern historiography stand, by their very nature, in radically different relations to the past. The latter represents, not an attempt at a restoration of memory, but a truly new kind of recollection. In its quest for understanding it brings to the fore texts, events, processes, that never really became part of Jewish group memory even when it was at its most vigorous. With unprecedented energy it continually recreates an ever more detailed past whose shapes and textures memory does not recognize. But that is not all. The historian does not simply come in to replenish the gaps of memory. He constantly challenges even those memories that have survived intact. Moreover, in common with historians in all fields of inquiry, he seeks ultimately to recover a total past—in this case the entire Jewish past—even if he is directly concerned with only a segment of it. No subject is potentially unworthy of his interest, no document, no artifact, beneath his attention. We {\textbar} understand the rationales for this. The point is that all these features cut against the grain of collective memory which, as we have remarked, is drastically selective. Certain memories live on; the rest are winnowed out, repressed, or simply discarded by a process of natural selection which the historian, uninvited, disturbs and reverses. The question remains whether, as a result, some genuine catharsis or reintegration is possible.” – Key point, to contrast with Ricoeur, Halbwachs etc: history is totalising and indiscriminate, where memory is “drastically selective.” Is this true?
*p. 95 – Collaboratively authored publications are never going to penetrate the collective memory: “Whatever their obvious merits as summations of the current state of knowledge they cannot, even when completed, add up to an interpretation of Jewish history. No symphony was ever written by committee.” – Yes, but many films and serials were!! This is a strong and probably utterly wrong-headed point. See also Rosenzweig and Chiu on the literary failings of Wikipedia.
p. 99 – “The choice for Jews as for non-Jews is not whether or not to have a past, but rather—what kind of past shall one have.”
p. 100 – The telos of history: “The notion that everything in the past is worth knowing ‘for its own sake’ is a mythology of modern historians, as is the lingering suspicion that a conscious responsibility toward the living concerns of the group must result in history that is somehow less scholarly or ‘scientific’. Both stances lead, not to science, but to antiquarianism.” – Take that, Halbwachs and Oakeshott!!
p. 100 – “Those who are alienated from the past cannot be drawn to it by explanation alone; they require evocation as well.”
p. 101 – “… I am equally convinced that a historiography that does not aspire to be memorable is in peril of becoming a rampant growth.”
Postscript. Reflections on Forgetting
pp. 108-9 – “Strictly speaking, peoples, groups, can only {\textbar} forget the present, not the past. That is to say, the individuals who comprise the group can forget events that occurred within their own lifetime; they are incapable of forgetting the past that preceded them, in the sense that the individual human being forgets earlier stages of his own life history. … A people can never ‘forget’ what it has never received in the first place.”
p. 113 – “Every ‘renaissance’, every ‘reformation’, reaches back into an often distant past to recover forgotten or neglected elements with which there is a sudden sympathetic vibration, a sense of empathy, of recognition. Inevitably, every such anamnesis also transforms the recovered past into something new; inexorably, it denigrates the intermediate past into something that deserves to be forgotten. In any case, if the achievement is not to be ephemeral, it must itself become a tradition, with all that this entails.”
p. 115 – Again, the relationship between historiography and “details”: “What working historian has not found in some dry and obscure monograph the tiny but vital link that he needed in order to pursue a larger theme? For the historian God, indeed, dwells in the details, though memory protests that the details have become gods. There is no way out of this impasse, for the issue lies elsewhere.”
*p. 115 – Why history needs memory: “If there be a malignancy, its source lies not in the historical quest, but in the loss of a halakhah that will know what to appropriate and what to leave behind, a commonality of values that would enable us to transform history into memory.”
p. 116 – The abuses of memory: “For the world in which we live it is no longer merely a question of the decay of collective memory and the declining consciousness of the past, but of the aggressive rape of whatever memory remains, the deliberate distortion of the historical record, the invention of mythological pasts in the service of the powers of darkness. Against the agents of oblivion, the shredders of documents, the assassins of memory, the revisers of encyclopedias, the conspirators of silence, against those who, in Kundera’s wonderful image, can airbrush a man out of a photograph so that nothing is left of him but his hat—only the historian, with the austere passion for fact, proof, evidence, which are central to his vocation, can effectively stand guard.”

Question: How photographs of war portray war and work on our feelings.
Answer: In lots of different ways, few of them pleasant, even fewer of them logically consistent with one another.
Sontag belongs to what Ricoeur calls the “tradition of inwardness” (Augustine, Locke, Husserl, Bergson, Casey):
p. 85 – “Photographs that everyone recognises are now a constituent part of what a society chooses to think about, or declares that it has chosen to think about. It calls these ideas ‘memories’, and that is, over the long run, a fiction. Strictly speaking, there is no such thing as collective memory—part of the same family of spurious notions as collective guilt. But there is collective instruction.”
p. 86 – “All memory is individual, unreproducible—it dies with each person. What is called collective memory is not a remembering but a stipulating: that this is important, and this is the story about how it happened, with the pictures that lock the story in our minds. Ideologies create substantiating archives of images, representative images, which encapsulate common ideas of significance and trigger predictable thoughts, feelings. Poster-ready photographs—the mushroom cloud of an A-bomb test, Martin Luther King, Jr., speaking at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C., the astronaut walking on the moon—are the visual equivalent of sound bites. They commemorate, in no less blunt fashion that postage stamps, Important Historical Moments; indeed, the triumphalist ones (the picture of the A-bomb excepted) become postage stamps. Fortunately, there is no one signature picture of the Nazi death camps.”
p. 87 – “Photographs of the suffering and martyrdom of a people are more than reminders of death, of failure, of victimization. They invoke the miracle of survival. To aim at the perpetuation of memories means, inevitably, that one has undertaken the task of continually renewing, of creating, memories—aided, above all, by the impress of iconic photographs. People want to be able to visit—and refresh—their memories. Now many victim peoples want a memory museum, a temple that houses a comprehensive, chronologically organized, illustrated narrative of their sufferings.”
p. 88 – Why we remember the suffering of others: “The Holocaust Memorial Museum and the future Armenian Genocide Museum and Memorial are about what didn’t happen in America, so the memory-work doesn’t risk arousing an embittered domestic population against authority.”
p. 89 – Photographs vs. text: “Harrowing photographs do not inevitably lose their power to shock. But they are not much help if the task is to understand. Narratives can make us understand. Photographs do something else: they haunt us.”
*p. 115 – Memory in relation to thinking, forgetting and forgiveness: “Perhaps too much value is assigned to memory, not enough to thinking. Remembering is an ethical act, has ethical value in and of itself. Memory is, achingly, the only relation we can have with the dead. … Heartlessness and amnesia seem to go together. But history gives contradictory signals about the value of remembering in the much longer span of a collective history. There is simply too much injustice in the world. And too much remembering (of ancient grievances: Serbs, Irish) embitters. To make peace is to forget. To reconcile, it is necessary that memory be faulty and limited.” – Has any other thinker contrasted memory with thinking? Todorov argues that certain kinds of memories can assist thinking (exemplary memories). Sontag seems to think that remembering interferes with thinking…
pp. 120-21 – The phenomenology of photographs/memory: “Much of the current skepticism about the work of certain photographers of conscience seems to amount to little more than displeasure at the fact that photographs are circulated so diversely; that there is no way to guarantee reverential conditions in which to look at these pictures and be fully responsive to them. Indeed, apart from the settings where patriotic deference to leaders is exercised, {\textbar} there seems no way to guarantee contemplative or inhibiting space for anything now.”

	abstract = {This article reflects on the expectations and changes that digital technologies have brought to history, activities that are increasingly codified as digital history. Because of the breadth of digital technologies and communicative media, the contours of a digital history are still unclear, so I frame my discussion with two potential narratives that begin from different ideas that emerged from World War II weapons research. One narrative begins with Roberto Busa and the application of a computer to find concordances in the writings of Saint Thomas Aquinas. The emphasis here is on the application of computer technologies to the practice of history. The second narrative begins with Vannevar Bush's essay “As We May Think” and focuses on digital technologies as a key element in an information system. This beginning invites a parallel between inscription technologies (especially the movable-type press) and knowledge systems. Both narratives imbibe the modern faith in technology to improve; the “new” is better, but the latter better involves humans and societies. Despite important differences between them, both narratives lead to an inquiry into the foundations of our modern knowledge system. In the case of history, the question is whether a knowledge system that was developed in the nineteenth century and designed to encompass and order the world into one system is still apposite in our digital world. I close by suggesting that one such presumption that needs to be reconsidered is the idea of the past as a prior and distant time-form. A shift from “the past” to “pasts” opens history to a broader field of previous happenings and a reconsideration of chronological time, of change, and to other modes of transmission, such as storytelling.},

This article describes the process and conceptual work that went into designing the book's interface. It emphasizes that hypertext enabled through digital means is not intrinsically more dynamic than print since work in both forms requires equally intensive hermeneutical effort. However, the digital realm provides a more expansive spectrum of tools to formulate concepts and to build on them. Digital presentation can be integrated into processes of theorizing, describing, and advocating that form the core of scholarship in the humanities. The article focuses on three areas—narrative, evidence, and context—that are central to modern historical work. My book's interface demonstrates that web capabilities are compositional tools whose deployment should be mulled over in a manner similar to how authors treat writing and editing. Moreover, we should take account of the quotidian fact that, in our environment, information and knowledge reach us extensively via computer-based mediation. Whether in books or in articles, academic work is assimilated through piecemeal delivery rather than bound volumes. Instead of romanticizing traditional forms whose import may be diminishing, historians and other humanities scholars can create new arguments by being attentive to the web's capabilities and to the current social conditions of possibility pertaining to the circulation of knowledge. Facility with digital composition can then feed back into all forms of humanistic thinking and writing.},

Our field's long-standing passive reliance on the widespread explanation of historical practice as deriving information from “primary sources” is unhelpful, incoherent, misleading, and an active inhibition to new opportunities. Our reliance on an incoherent explanation means our students are not given a precise description of our historical practice but instead learn to imitate us by gradually adopting disciplinary norms conveyed through exemplary models and the critique of work performed. Furthermore, our reliance on a misleading explanation of method means we lack a common terminology with which we all can coherently explain to our peers what we actually do. We know this, and yet we have provided no alternative. The current moment offers an opportunity to provide a theory of the practice of history that encompasses contemporary, traditional, and even ancient historical methods: capturing sources, producing data, and creating facts. Wide acceptance and implementation of a sources-data-facts model of historical practice will accelerate student understanding, improve communication with other disciplines, erase the apparent distinction between (so-called) analog and digital history, and provide a framework for the publication of historical data as a valuable end in and of itself.},

The quick pace of technological change often renders digital scholarship obsolete, which in turn encourages historians to retreat to the stable and durable comfort of print, even as digital methodologies enrich our research and expand the audience for it. What has been missing so far in the conversation about digital history is a clear understanding of how it differs from traditional historical products, what can be gained from it, and how we might document the work undertaken using these machine-based methodologies. Because it is best understood as a process rather than as a product, digital history must have a history of its own to tether it to the scholarly community and to ensure that it endures past the active phase of any project. This article argues that digital historians should catalog their work using a normalized template following the Digital Documentation Process, a guide for producing documentation that is suitable for computer-based historical scholarship and tailored to its specific parameters. Self-documentation is beneficial to those who create digital history and those who consume it. It is urgent to establish a field-wide expectation that digital history will be consistently documented as a matter of course, lest we lose scholarship that has already been produced and forgo the enormous opportunities that computer-enabled methodologies offer to historians.},

This article argues for a closer look at the traditions of history writing in order to understand its principles and to determine what the digital condition contributes to historiography. Does the work of historians actually change in principle, or does digital history instead reflect the digital condition under which we operate? The article begins with a reflection on the works of Wilhelm Dilthey and Michel de Certeau to discuss how the society in which the historian writes influences the practices of interpretation. The article then presents what can be understood as the digital condition of our present societies and shows how algorithms function as “black boxes” that influence our social interactions, communication, and understanding of the world. The article's third part brings together the earlier discussions of practices of history writing and the digital condition in order to examine the role of modeling for knowledge production in the sciences and the humanities. The closing argument then focuses on the use of visualizations in digital history as an example of the operational use of models of knowledge in opening the “black box” of interpretation.},

I begin by outlining the two properties of computers that I argue define digital history: they process data and (as Janet H. Murray noted) provide an immersive and interactive medium. I then examine how digital historians in the United States have employed those affordances. That process has proceeded unevenly, with computers having been used as a medium before they were employed to process data, and has produced additive forms—digital archives, digital public history, data analysis published in print—that rely on existing formats rather than on the affordances of computers. While such forms are a necessary step toward a more fully realized digital history, their prevalence suggests that it will take some time for that process to play out. The final section looks to recently published and forthcoming long-form digital arguments for the direction of that development. Examples from Stanford University Press's Digital Projects series point to some of the ways that the data analysis and the immersive and interactive medium of the computer might be combined.},

Using the two rooms approach of Alan Turing's imitation game, I highlight the potential for machine and human histories to be recognized via at least the idea of weak artificial intelligence. This recognition illuminates the mixed nature of the logic of history, combining deductions and endoxa. Finally, I note that illuminating and exploring this mixed logic of history signals a turn to historiographical metaphysics with Aristotelian features and, thus, the recognition of histories by professional historians as only part of a historiographical world. This signals that the recognition of machine and human history makers does not simply turn on the acknowledgement of imitation.},

AI has probably also already invaded the history classroom. Large language models such as GPT-3 are able to generate compelling, non-plagiarized texts in response to simple natural language inputs, thus providing students with an opportunity to produce high-quality written assignments with minimum effort. In a similar vein, tools like GPT-3 are likely to revolutionize historical studies, enabling historians and other professionals who deal in texts to rely on AI-generated intermediate work products, such as accurate translations, summaries, and chronologies. But present-day large language models fail at key tasks that historians hold in high regard. They are structurally incapable of telling the truth and tracking pieces of information through layers of texts. What's more, they lack ethical self-reflexivity. Therefore, for the time being, the writing of academic history will require human agency. But for historical theorists, large language models might offer an opportunity to test basic hypotheses about the nature of historical writing. Historical theorists can, for instance, have customized large language models write a series of descriptive, narrative, and assertive histories about the same events, thereby enabling them to explore the precise relation between description, narration, and argumentation in historical writing. In short, with specifically designed large language models, historical theorists can run the kinds of large-scale writing experiments that they could never put into practice with real historians.},

	abstract = {Holocaust memorial sites and institutions have begun to embrace new media and digital technologies as methods of communication, public engagement, and memorialization. Despite increasing numbers of interactive digital media projects focused on Holocaust education, there is a significant gulf between the topics addressed by digital Holocaust works and those conceptualized and studied at a higher level in scholarly Holocaust literature. Most notably, challenging questions regarding the categories of bystandership, complicity, and perpetration are largely ignored in favor of traditional victim-focused narratives. I suggest that, in their eagerness to adopt virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR) technologies, digital Holocaust memory projects have neglected the significant potential of nonimmersive video games to address questions regarding bystandership and complicity. By moving away from the perceptual immersion of VR and toward the ludic and simulative arguments of video games, digitally interactive Holocaust projects may be able to lessen the risks of over-immersion and retraumatization that are antithetical to critical historical thinking and understanding. This article examines the 2013 game Papers, Please as an example of how video games can present sophisticated arguments about human agency, bystandership, and complicity. By placing players in a historical problem space laden with impossible moral choices, Papers, Please demonstrates the systemic forces that structure human behavior under extreme, violent, and authoritarian conditions. I argue that Holocaust-based ludic digital media modeled after Papers, Please could explore bystandership and complicity in similarly nuanced and powerful ways, potentially touching on academic Holocaust concepts such as the “choiceless choices” of “the gray zone.” Addressing these topics in ludic historical media could help to bridge the gap between popular and scholarly understandings of the Holocaust in the twenty-first century.},

At the core of the article, we formulate our call for a collective investigation of modalities of historical futures and sketch three basic sets of concerns that the explorative works in this experiment may address: kinds of transitions from past to futures, kinds of anticipatory practices, and kinds of registers as interpretive tools that position such practices on a variety of spectrums between two poles (for instance, a value register with the poles of catastrophic and redemptive futures).

Starting from an understanding of memory that centers on memory's temporality, its relation to language, and its quality as a social action, the essay puts forward the concept of “entangled memory.” On a theoretical level, it brings to the fore the entangledness of acts of remembering. In a synchronic perspective, memory's entangledness is presented as twofold. Every act of remembering inscribes an individual in multiple social frames. This polyphony entails the simultaneous existence of concurrent interpretations of the past. In a diachronic perspective, memory is entangled in the dynamic relation between single acts of remembering and changing mnemonic patterns. Memory scholars therefore uncover boundless cross-referential configurations. Wishing to enhance the dialogue between the theoretical and the empirical parts of memory studies, we propose four devices that serve as a heuristic in the study of memory's entanglement: chronology against time, conflict, generations, and self-reflexivity. Current debates on European memory permit us to explore the possible benefits that the concept of entangled memory carries for memory studies.},

	abstract = {The memory wave in the humanities has contributed to the impressive revival of cultural history, but the success of memory studies has not been accompanied by significant conceptual and methodological advances in the research of collective memory processes. Most studies on memory focus on the representation of specific events within particular chronological, geographical, and media settings without reflecting on the audiences of the representations in question. As a result, the wealth of new insights into past and present historical cultures cannot be linked conclusively to specific social collectives and their historical consciousness. This methodological problem is even enhanced by the metaphorical use of psychological and neurological terminology, which misrepresents the social dynamics of collective memory as an effect and extension of individual, autobiographical memory. Some of these shortcomings can be addressed through the extensive contextualization of specific strategies of representation, which links facts of representation with facts of reception. As a result, the history of collective memory would be recast as a complex process of cultural production and consumption that acknowledges the persistence of cultural traditions as well as the ingenuity of memory makers and the subversive interests of memory consumers. The negotiations among these three different historical agents create the rules of engagement in the competitive arena of memory politics, and the reconstruction of these negotiations helps us distinguish among the abundance of failed collective memory initiatives on the one hand and the few cases of successful collective memory construction on the other. For this purpose, collective memory studies should adopt the methods of communication and media studies, especially with regard to media reception, and continue to use a wide range of interpretive tools from traditional historiography to poststructural approaches. From the perspective of collective memory studies, these two traditions are closely related and mutually beneficial, rather than mutually exclusive, ways of analyzing historical cultures.},

The article discusses the difficulty of developing a mode of thinking about the present that would attempt to hold together these two rather different senses of time and ends with a ground-clearing exercise that might enable the development of such thought.},

While many factors are contributing to this phenomenon, information and communication technologies are seen as the main drivers. This article considers the way social theorists analyse the concepts of time and speed and then examines how these claims might be assessed in the light of empirical research. Such research shows that time compression has multiple dimensions, and that the effect of digital devices like the mobile phone is not simply one of acceleration. In particular, I suggest that the social studies of technology offers a richer analysis of the reciprocal relationship between technological innovation and changing time practices. My argument is that while the hitherto neglected temporal dimension in sociological theory is now being addressed, there is an urgent need for increased dialogue to connect social theory with detailed empirical studies. Without this, we will continue to have difficulty distinguishing social science from science fiction.},

We explore this integration of fact and value in an unexpected setting: the “talk pages” of the online encyclopedia Wikipedia in which discussions of article creation are recorded. Our analysis of these discussions draws on Nelson Goodman’s Ways of Worldmaking, another classic on the social construction of reality, which catalogues strategies for producing a worldview. We utilize Goodman’s theories in four cases of Wikipedia article creation – two histories, “Iraq War” and “Afghanistan War,” and two biographies, “George W. Bush” and “Barack Obama” – all of which reveal how knowledge products are created.},

	abstract = {Based on a mixed-method case study of online communication about the Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, this article argues that online communication plays out as a centrifugal narration process with centripetal consequences. Through a content analysis of communication about Novo Nordisk, three dominant online meaning constructions that present themselves as narratives are identified and their convergence into one overarching meta-narrative is identified. The meta-narrative of Novo Nordisk as the ruthlessly profit-seeking socially responsible heavenly work place is made up of the three interrelated, yet disparate tales about Novo Nordisk as (1) a socially responsible organization, engaged in society at large; (2) an organization primarily concerned with fulfilling its own objectives – profit maximization; and (3) a great and employee-centred workplace. The article then discusses the theoretical and methodological implications of the empirical findings. It is argued that although the findings are not in themselves surprising, they adequately reflect that online meaning formation is, indeed, a collaborative process in which centrifugal forces have centripetal consequences. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the chosen mixed-method case study successfully navigates the dilemma of studying online collaborative processes through the traces they leave behind.},

Less attention, however, has been given to the fact that voice assistants are also web interfaces that might impact on how the web is accessed, understood and employed by users. This article aims to advance work in this context by identifying a range of issues that should spark additional reflections and discussions within communication and media studies and related fields. In particular, the article focuses on three key issues that have to do with long-standing discussions about the social and political impact of the internet: the role of web platforms in shaping information access, the relationship between production and consumption online, and the role of affect in informing engagement with web resources. Considering these issues in regard to voice assistants not only helps contextualize these technologies within existing debates in communication and media studies, but also highlights that voice assistants pose novel questions to internet research, challenging assumptions of what the web looks like as speech becomes one of the key ways to access resources and information online.},

	abstract = {In the digital memories literature, the practice of searching for information – one of the most frequent online activities worldwide – has received comparatively little attention. To fill the gap, this exploratory study asks how search engines affect the representations of the past that they produce in query results. Designed as a single revelatory case study, with a focus on Russia, this article delineates a typology of four types of memory events based on four types of websites dominating search results. For each type of event, we discuss recurring locations and mechanisms of power struggles over competing memory narratives. We conclude that within Russia’s authoritarian context, the mnemonic practice of Internet searching tends to reproduce and reinforce the dominant narratives supported by the ruling elites. Search engine companies are thus only one of several powerful institutions that constitute the social framework within which querying the Internet is pursued as a mnemonic practice. Others include mass media, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and online encyclopaedias.},
